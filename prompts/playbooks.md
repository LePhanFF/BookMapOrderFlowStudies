# MASTER PLAYBOOK: Day-Type Specific Strategies (v2026-01-26 — Final Integrated)

**Core Principles (Apply to ALL Day Types — Non-Negotiable)**

* **Lanto 3/3 Required** for full size (2/3 half, <2/3 micro/flat)
* **IB is Law 90%** — First 60-min range sets directional framework
* **Trend Strength Classification (The Decision Gate)**: For Trend Up/Down days, classify strength using ONLY these 4 values:
* **Weak**:  IB range extension; minimal/no full bracket hold; hovering/poke behavior; decelerating migration.
* **Moderate**:  IB range extension;  full 30-min hold/close outside IBH/IBL; emerging fattening.
* **Strong**:  IB range extension;  min stacked brackets; sustained fattening/migration.
* **Super**:  IB range extension OR extreme DPOC migration/compression against VAH/VAL +  min hold.


* **Mandatory Reasoning Bullet**: "Trend strength: {Weak | Moderate | Strong | Super} — [IB extension multiple + bracket hold detail]".
* **Acceptance Gates**: 2×5-min closes + DPOC migration + volume beyond extreme (poke ≠ acceptance)
* **DPOC Migration = Final Arbiter** after 11:00 ET
* **Trailing Oath**: +150 NQ pts → BE + 30-min trail | +300 pts → 33% free ride
* **Key Levels Hierarchy** (pullback priority): IBH/IBL retest > VWAP kiss/reclaim > dPOC step/retest > LVN seam > 4H/daily FVG > HVN nodes
* **SMT Cross-Check**: NQ primary; ES/YM divergence = caution/reversal clue. **Symmetric SMT Break**: A reversal is confirmed when **both NQ and ES** simultaneously trade back into the IB (under IBH for bulls, over IBL for bears).
* **Wick Parade ≥6**: Responsive override (≥6 lower = long bias, ≥6 upper = short bias)
* **VAH/VAL Late-Day Rule (All Trend Days)**: At VAH do **not** initiate or add longs if single-print rejection or poor high is already forming — go neutral or size down. Mirror at VAL for shorts. No FOMO at extremes — require clear rejection/poor structure confirmation for edge. In strong trends with POC/DPOC compressing hard against VAH/VAL, pullbacks are often shallow, but **always examine final 30-min TPO prints 15:00–16:00** for confirmation before holding/add into close.
* **STAND DOWN DISCIPLINE (Mandatory Oath)**: When the setup is unclear, no canonical trigger, <3/3 Lanto, middle-of-range chop, conflicting time-of-day (e.g., lunch lull, pre-15:00 stall), or TPO showing reversal signals (poor high/low forming, single-print rejection, DPOC stall/roll, opposite wick parade), **immediately stand down — hands under lap, no touching the platform**.
* **Specific Weak Trend Stand Down**: If Trend Strength is **Weak (<0.5)** and there is no Symmetric SMT break, or if a major **HVN/LVN** blocks the path, expect no PM Morph.
* The market will always give a cleaner, higher-conviction setup later. Forcing trades in ambiguity is the #1 account killer. Patience prints.
* **LUNCH FADE** Becareful of lunch fade occurring after london closes 12:15 to 12:45 PM, market might retrace after a big morning push.  Make sure confidence score is under 65%, don't get overzaleous at extreme and transition during london close.

## OPENING RANGE & EARLY PLAYS (09:30–10:30 ET — Applies Across All Day Types)

Our system is IB-centric (60-min law 90%), so early opening range plays are **restrained** — used primarily for bias confirmation, not full-size directional bets unless Lanto 3/3 + acceptance. Early pokes often fake out. Always cross-check with Lanto ORM, compression, and Dalton opening type. These are **not full day-types** but early setups that feed into IB resolution and day-type morph (e.g., OD can lead to Trend Day).

Playbook organized by opening type/OR. Each includes:

* Lanto gate
* Identification clues
* Primary bias
* Entry model (pullbacks preferred on trend days)
* Stop logic
* Multiple targets (scaled exits)
* Notes + Caution call-out

### 1. Dalton Opening Types (First 5–30 min Behavior)

#### Open Drive (OD): Immediate Initiative Displacement

**Lanto Gate**: Half size max early (full only on 3/3 + acceptance beyond OR extreme)

**Clues**: First 5–15 min shows clean displacement (e.g., 50+ NQ pts) + volume spike in one direction, minimal overlap/TPO fattening. DPOC starts migrating immediately. Often after compression/SMT divergence. ≥3 consecutive 5-min candles one-timeframing (higher highs/lows up, lower highs/lows down).

**Bias**: Strong directional (up = long, down = short) – highest early conviction.

**Entry Model**:

* Primary: First pullback to OR low/high (retest hold) + 5-min bullish/bearish IFVG inversion.
* Secondary: Retest FVG from opening bar + close in direction.
* LTF: 1-min FVG stack + volume confirmation.

**Stops**:

* Tight: Below/above opening swing low/high (5–10 pts buffer).
* Structural: Below/above ONL/ONH if aligned.

**Targets (Scale Out)**:

1. First scale: Measured OR range extension (+50–100 pts).
2. Runner: Next HTF level (prior day high/low, VWAP).
3. Extension: IB projection if morphs to Trend.

**Notes**: Pyramid only if DPOC migrates with it. Common precursor to Trend Day. Confidence: 80–90% if Lanto Price Action clean + volume.
**Caution Call-out**: Fake-out if no 2×5-min acceptance (poke only) – immediate stand down, fade back. **Stand down triggers**: Opposite wick parade ≥4 early or DPOC stall = hands under lap.

#### Open Auction In Range (OAIR): Two-Sided Chop Inside Prior Value

**Lanto Gate**: Micro/flat only – rarely 3/3 early

**Clues**: Balanced 5–15 min rotation inside prior VA/ON range, symmetric TPO build, flat DPOC, low volume. No clear displacement. Often after messy pre-open.

**Bias**: Neutral early – chop risk.

**Entry Model**:

* Micro fades only: Poor high/low inside OR + single-print rejection.
* No directional: Wait for IB.

**Stops**:

* Outside OR extreme (tight 5–10 pts).

**Targets**:

1. POC/VWAP mean reversion.
2. Opposite OR edge.

**Notes**: Common on balance days. Stand down directional until breakout acceptance.
**Caution Call-out**: Any early poke without acceptance = fade back. **Stand down triggers**: No clear edge or middle chop = hands under lap.

#### Open Rejection Reverse (ORR): Early Probe Rejected → Reversal

**Lanto Gate**: Half size max on rejection (full on 3/3 + acceptance away from probe)

**Clues**: 5–15 min probe beyond reference (prior high/low, ONH/ONL) + sharp rejection (wick parade ≥4, single prints form). DPOC snaps opposite. Volume on rejection > probe.

**Bias**: Contrarian reversal (e.g., probe up → short bias).

**Entry Model**:

* Primary: Rejection extreme fade + 5-min FVG retest in reversal direction.
* LTF: IFVG inversion on rejection bar + close away.

**Stops**:

* Beyond probe extreme (10–15 pts wide to account for volatility).

**Targets**:

1. OR opposite extreme.
2. Prior VA/POC.
3. Measured probe wick extension opposite.

**Notes**: High-edge if Lanto 2–3/3. Often sets up ORR into Trend Morph.
**Caution Call-out**: Failed rejection (acceptance beyond probe) = immediate flip/flat. **Stand down triggers**: No sharp rejection or conflicting volume = hands under lap.

#### Open Outside Prior Range (OO): Gap Beyond Yesterday Without Drive

**Lanto Gate**: Micro early (full only on 3/3 + acceptance away from gap)

**Clues**: Open gaps beyond prior range/VA but no immediate displacement/volume. TPO builds neutrally. DPOC flat early.

**Bias**: Neutral – gap magnet unless proven otherwise.

**Entry Model**:

* Wait for acceptance: Away from gap = directional (retest FVG away).
* Toward gap = fade (IFVG inversion toward magnet).

**Stops**:

* Beyond gap edge or OR extreme.

**Targets**:

1. Gap fill (prior close/VA).
2. Opposite OR extension if acceptance away.

**Notes**: No chase – wait for IB. Common fake-out.
**Caution Call-out**: No acceptance = stand aside. **Stand down triggers**: Messy chop or no clear direction = hands under lap.

### 2. Short-Term Opening Range Plays (5-min / 15-min / 30-min OR)

#### 5-min OR Breakout: Very Early Displacement

**Lanto Gate**: Micro only

**Clues**: First bar displaces 30+ NQ pts + extreme volume. DPOC starts migrating. Often OD variant.

**Bias**: Directional bump if Lanto Price Action clean.

**Entry Model**:

* Micro: Retest OR low/high + 1-min FVG inversion.

**Stops**:

* Opposite first bar extreme (tight 5 pts).

**Targets**:

1. Measured bar range extension.
2. Next 15-min projection.

**Notes**: High fake-out – no size up.
**Caution Call-out**: No volume/acceptance = immediate fade. **Stand down triggers**: Poke only = hands under lap.

#### 15-min OR Breakout: First 15-min High/Low Break

**Lanto Gate**: Half size max

**Clues**: Break after 15-min consolidation + volume spike. DPOC migrates with break. Aligned with Lanto ORM.

**Bias**: Directional if acceptance.

**Entry Model**:

* Primary: Retest breakout level + 5-min FVG retest.

**Stops**:

* Back inside OR (10 pts buffer).

**Targets**:

1. Measured 15-min range extension (+50 pts).
2. 30-min/IB projection.

**Notes**: Bias bump – require 2×5-min acceptance.
**Caution Call-out**: Rejection back inside = fade. **Stand down triggers**: No volume/migration = hands under lap.

#### 30-min OR Breakout: Stronger Signal, Closer to IB

**Lanto Gate**: Full size possible on 3/3 + acceptance

**Clues**: Break after 30-min build + DPOC migration + volume. Often leads to Trend.

**Bias**: Strong directional lock if confirmed.

**Entry Model**:

* Primary: Pullback to OR extreme + IFVG inversion.
* Add: On DPOC step.

**Stops**:

* Back inside OR extreme (15–20 pts).

**Targets**:

1. IB projection (+100 pts).
2. Prior extreme/VA.

**Notes**: Solid Trend precursor.
**Caution Call-out**: No acceptance = stand down. **Stand down triggers**: Conflicting SMT/DPOC = hands under lap.

**General Rules for All OR Plays**:

* **Restraint**: IB law overrides — early OR breaks often repair unless DPOC migrates with it.
* **Compression Variant**: Tight 5/15-min range + lower-wick parade ≥6 (upper hug) = strong directional bias. Default long on upper compression hug (Nov–Dec seasonality).
* **Lanto Integration**: Use first 15–30 min ORM for Price Action Model score. Clean displacement + volume + location = early permission.
* **Stand Down**: No acceptance + poke only = hands under lap. Wait for IB.

These opening plays feed directly into day-type classification and full IB resolution.

### 1. Trend Day Bull (Standard Uptrend — Displacement Above IBH All Day)

**Lanto Gate**: Full size only on 3/3 + **Strength ≥ Moderate** (>0.5 extension).

**Clues**: Early acceptance above IBH, DPOC migrates up steadily (>100 pts total), elongated upper distribution, poor low early, single prints high rejected repeatedly. **Stronger acceptance: Price accepting 30 min above IBH with rejection on IBH retest. Stronger evidence includes POC jumping and compressing up against VAH, above IBH, DPOC steadily rising with velocity and acceleration.** Rigid 5/5 checklist (all required for true Trend Day call): ≥80% RTH outside IB range; ≥3 consecutive 30-min periods fully outside IB + monotonic DPOC migration; ≥4 consecutive 30/60-min candles one-timeframing (higher highs/lows); elongated thin TPO profile with fattening only at directional extreme; ≥70% RTH outside prior day’s Value Area.

**TPO Structural Signpost**: Must have **Excess (Tail)** of ≥3 TPOs at the low of the day (rejection of lower prices).

**Bias**: MAX LONG (if Strength ≥ Moderate).

**Entry Model**:

* Primary: Pullback to IBH retest (hold) or VWAP reclaim after probe
* Secondary: dPOC step higher + retest, or LVN seam rejection above IBH
* LTF: 1-min/5-min bullish FVG inversion + close above

**Stops**:

* Tight: Below swing low of pullback bar or prior 5-min low
* Structural: Below IBH or nearest LVN (never below IBL on clean trend)

**Targets (Scale Out)**:

1. First scale: VAH extension or next HVN node (+100–150 pts)
2. Runner: Prior day high / weekly HVN (+200–300 pts)
3. Extension: Measured IB range add from IBH, or 1.618 fib of opening leg

**Notes**: Pyramid on acceptance + DPOC jump. Late-day PM leg common — carry runners. 5/5 = 95–100% confidence (MAX conviction, full pyramid); 4/5 = Trend-Day Morph (full size OK, trail tighter); 3/5 or less = Strong Directional / P-Day with extension (half size max, fade edges possible).

**ALTERNATIVE: The "Weak Trend" (Failed Extension) Fade Model**
*If Trend Strength is **Weak (<0.5x)** and price "pokes" above IBH without holding:*

* **Confirmation**: TPO rejection (excess) at high; price trades **below VAH**; failed 3rd/4th attempt mid-PM to take out AM swing high.
* **Trigger**: **Symmetric SMT Break** (NQ and ES both trade under IBH).
* **Bias Shift**: Fade the Rally (Target: POC/VAL).

**Caution Call-out**:

* At VAH: **Do not go/add long if single-print rejection or poor high already forming** — neutral or size down until clear rejection confirmation. No FOMO.
* POC/DPOC compressing hard against VAH = shallow pullbacks likely, but **examine final 30-min TPO prints 15:00–16:00** — poor high formation, single prints, or DPOC stall/roll = high risk of late retrace to POC/VWAP. ≥6 upper wicks at extreme = immediate bias downgrade.
* **Stand down triggers**: Unclear TPO (symmetric fattening, no migration), lunch lull, or any reversal signal = hands under lap.

---

### 2. Super Trend Day Bull (Explosive — Extreme DPOC Migration >300–400 pts)

**Lanto Gate**: Full size + pyramid only on 3/3 + **Strength = Super** (>2.0 extension).

**Clues**: DPOC extreme migration (>300 pts), super-trending call early (DPOC above IBH by 10:30), fattening upper, single prints rejected instantly, volume builds on breakout. **Stronger acceptance: Price accepting 30 min above IBH with rejection on IBH retest. Stronger evidence includes POC jumping and compressing up against VAH, above IBH, DPOC steadily rising with velocity and acceleration.** Meets rigid 5/5 checklist (all required for true Trend Day call): ≥80% RTH outside IB range; ≥3 consecutive 30-min periods fully outside IB + monotonic DPOC migration; ≥4 consecutive 30/60-min candles one-timeframing (higher highs/lows); elongated thin TPO profile with fattening only at directional extreme; ≥70% RTH outside prior day’s Value Area. Plus extreme additives (migration >300 pts, wick parade ≥8).

**TPO "Never Fill" Rule**: Single prints (velocity seams) created above IBH must remain **unfilled**. If price fills mid-day prints, momentum has died.

**Bias**: MAX LONG + aggressive pyramid

**Entry Model**:

* Early: IBH breakout acceptance (2×5-min + volume)
* Add-ons: Every VWAP/dPOC retest, or consecutive 30-min DPOC jumps ≥30–40 pts **(single-print high rejections = permanent gift adds)**
* LTF: Clean displacement + 5-min FVG stack in direction

**Stops**:

* Initial: Below IBL (wide buffer on explosive days) or exact prior 30-min low
* Trail aggressively after +150 pts

**Targets**:

1. First scale: +200 pts or nearest weekly HVN
2. Second: +400 pts or measured move from ON low
3. Free ride: Weekly extreme or 2.0 fib extension

**Notes**: Highest conviction. Confidence scaling: Base + additives (migration, fattening, HTF FVG stack). 5/5 = 95–100% confidence (MAX conviction, full pyramid); 4/5 = Trend-Day Morph (full size OK, trail tighter); 3/5 or less = Strong Directional / P-Day with extension (half size max, fade edges possible).
**Caution Call-out**:

* At VAH: **Do not go/add long if single-print rejection or poor high already forming** — neutral or size down until clear rejection confirmation. No FOMO.
* POC/DPOC compressing hard against VAH = shallow pullbacks likely, but **examine final 30-min TPO prints 15:00–16:00** — poor high formation, single prints, or DPOC stall/roll = high risk of late retrace to POC/VWAP. ≥6 upper wicks at extreme = immediate bias downgrade.
* **Stand down triggers**: Any sign of momentum loss (DPOC stall, opposite wicks, poor high forming) = hands under lap immediately.

---

### 3. Trend Day Bear (Standard Downtrend — Displacement Below IBL All Day)

**Lanto Gate**: Full size only on 3/3 + **Strength ≥ Moderate** (>0.5 extension).

**Clues**: Mirror of bull — acceptance below IBL, DPOC migrates down steadily, elongated lower distribution, poor high early, gift seam shorts at LVN overhead. **Stronger acceptance: Price accepting 30 min below IBL with rejection on IBL retest. Stronger evidence includes POC jumping down and compressing against VAL, below IBL, DPOC steadily dropping with velocity and acceleration.** Rigid 5/5 checklist (all required for true Trend Day call): ≥80% RTH outside IB range; ≥3 consecutive 30-min periods fully outside IB + monotonic DPOC migration; ≥4 consecutive 30/60-min candles one-timeframing (lower highs/lows); elongated thin TPO profile with fattening only at directional extreme; ≥70% RTH outside prior day’s Value Area.

**TPO Structural Signpost**: Must have **Excess (Tail)** of ≥3 TPOs at the high of the day (rejection of higher prices).

**Bias**: MAX SHORT

**Entry Model**:

* Primary: Pullback to IBL retest (fail) or VWAP rejection
* Secondary: dPOC step lower + retest, LVN seam rejection below IBL
* LTF: Bearish 5-min FVG inversion

**Stops**:

* Tight: Above swing high of pullback
* Structural: Above IBL or nearest HVN

**Targets**:

1. VAL extension or next LVN node
2. Prior day low / weekly LVN
3. Measured IB range subtract from IBL

**Notes**: Watch liquidation volume drying post-14:00 — shift to bounce fades. 5/5 = 95–100% confidence (MAX conviction, full pyramid); 4/5 = Trend-Day Morph (full size OK, trail tighter); 3/5 or less = Strong Directional / P-Day with extension (half size max, fade edges possible).

**ALTERNATIVE: The "Weak Trend" (Failed Flush) Bounce Model**
*If Trend Strength is **Weak (<0.5x)** and price pokes below IBL without holding:*

* **Confirmation**: TPO rejection at the low; price trades **above VAL**; failed 3rd/4th attempt mid-PM to take out AM swing low.
* **Trigger**: **Symmetric SMT Break** (NQ and ES both trade over IBL).
* **Bias Shift**: Fade the Flush (Target: POC/VAH).

**Caution Call-out**:

* At VAL: **Do not go/add short if single-print rejection or poor low already forming** — neutral or size down until clear rejection confirmation. No FOMO.
* POC/DPOC compressing hard against VAL = shallow pullbacks likely, but **examine final 30-min TPO prints 15:00–16:00** — poor low formation, single prints, or DPOC stall/roll = high risk of late bounce to POC/VWAP. ≥6 lower wicks at extreme = immediate bias downgrade.
* **Stand down triggers**: Unclear TPO (symmetric fattening, no migration), lunch lull, or any reversal signal = hands under lap.

---

### 4. Super Trend Day Bear (Extreme Liquidation)

**Lanto Gate**: Full size + pyramid only on 3/3 + **Strength = Super** (>2.0 extension).

**Clues**: DPOC < IBL early, extreme migration (>400 pts down), multiple LVN seam rejections (gift zone permanent after 2), high-volume breakdown. **Stronger acceptance: Price accepting 30 min below IBL with rejection on IBL retest. Stronger evidence includes POC jumping down and compressing against VAL, below IBL, DPOC steadily dropping with velocity and acceleration.** Meets rigid 5/5 checklist (all required for true Trend Day call): ≥80% RTH outside IB range; ≥3 consecutive 30-min periods fully outside IB + monotonic DPOC migration; ≥4 consecutive 30/60-min candles one-timeframing (lower highs/lows); elongated thin TPO profile with fattening only at directional extreme; ≥70% RTH outside prior day’s Value Area. Plus extreme additives (migration >300 pts, wick parade ≥8).

**TPO "Gift Seam" Rule**: Single-print low rejections are permanent gift adds. Velocity seams must remain **unfilled**.

**Bias**: MAX SHORT + pyramid

**Entry Model**:

* Early: IBL breakdown acceptance
* Add-ons: LVN seam retests (every rejection = add) **(single-print low rejections = permanent gift adds)**
* LTF: Volume spike on lower lows

**Stops**:

* Initial: Above IBH (wide on liquidation days)
* Trail: 30-min trail after +150 pts

**Targets**:

1. –200 pts or nearest weekly LVN
2. –400 pts or measured flush from ON high
3. Extension: Weekly low or prior major support

**Notes**: Gift seam threshold = 2 rejections on high-conviction days. 5/5 = 95–100% confidence (MAX conviction, full pyramid); 4/5 = Trend-Day Morph (full size OK, trail tighter); 3/5 or less = Strong Directional / P-Day with extension (half size max, fade edges possible).
**Caution Call-out**:

* At VAL: **Do not go/add short if single-print rejection or poor low already forming** — neutral or size down until clear rejection confirmation. No FOMO.
* POC/DPOC compressing hard against VAL = shallow pullbacks likely, but **examine final 30-min TPO prints 15:00–16:00** — poor low formation, single prints, or DPOC stall/roll = high risk of late bounce to POC/VWAP. ≥6 lower wicks at extreme = immediate bias downgrade.
* **Stand down triggers**: Any sign of momentum loss (DPOC stall, opposite wicks, poor low forming) = hands under lap immediately.

---

### 5. P-Day (Skewed Balance — "p" Bullish or "b" Bearish Skew)

**Lanto Gate**: Full size only on 3/3 + resolution trigger

**Clues**: Compressed IB, skewed TPO shape ("p" upper hug/fattening + thin below; "b" lower), DPOC migration directional all day, single prints/poor extreme opposite. Checklist ≥4/6: TPO skewed ≥50% upper/lower 1/3; DPOC migration >50 pts; hug ≥2 hours; VA skewed; single prints opposite; modest range 150–300 pts.
**Strength Note**: If IB extension is **Weak (<0.5)**, assume this will likely resolve as Balance rather than Trend.

**Bias**: Directional (upper "p" = long, lower "b" = short) but restrained early

**Entry Model**:

* Wait for resolution: Single prints + fattening direction + DPOC compressing into VAH/VAL
* Entry: Break of single-print excess with acceptance; hug zone retest + 5-min FVG inversion
* Add: On DPOC steps in skew direction

**Stops**:

* Opposite side of skew (e.g., below VAL on "p")
* Tight: Beyond poor extreme (10–20 pts)

**Targets**:

1. VAH/VAL extreme
2. Opposite poor high/low
3. Measured excess repair

**Notes**: Early neutral — no size until resolution. Most common printable day (85–90% directional win rate). ≥5/6 + single prints reject = Confirmed (80–95% confidence). Best in compression + HTF alignment (Nov–Dec).
**Caution Call-out**: Failed resolution (symmetric fattening, flat DPOC) = downgrade to Neutral/chop. DPOC flattens/reverses >45 min = invalidation. **Stand down triggers**: No clear resolution or conflicting TPO/time = hands under lap.

---

### 6. B-Day (Narrow IB, No Extension — True Trapped Balance)

**Lanto Gate**: Micro/flat only — rarely 3/3

**Clues**: Narrow IB, price never leaves first hour (**Strength: Weak**), symmetric build, flat DPOC.

**Bias**: Neutral — edge fades only

**Entry Model**:

* Fade extremes: Poor high/low inside IB, POC/VWAP bounces
* No directional size

**Stops**:

* Outside IB extreme

**Targets**:

1. POC/VWAP mean
2. Opposite edge

**Notes**: Micro only. Middle = death.
**Caution Call-out**: Any breakout attempt without acceptance = fade back into range. **Stand down triggers**: No edge or middle chop = hands under lap.

---

### 7. Neutral Day (Symmetric Balance — Chop Risk)

**Lanto Gate**: Micro/flat only — rarely 3/3

**Clues**: Symmetric fattening center, multiple HVN, rotational probes repaired, flat DPOC, low ATR. Both-side extensions, no sustained hug.

**Bias**: Neutral — only edge fades

**Entry Model**:

* Poor high/low fades
* SMT divergence scalps
* POC/VWAP bounces inside VA

**Stops**:

* Outside VAH/VAL

**Targets**:

1. POC/VWAP
2. Opposite VA edge

**Notes**: Explicit chop risk. No directional conviction. Rare in trending HTF.
**Caution Call-out**: Late DPOC migration + acceptance = potential morph — stand aside until confirmed. **Stand down triggers**: Any ambiguity or no clear edge = hands under lap.

---

### 8. Trend Day PM Morph (Early Balance → Late Trend)

**Lanto Gate**: Full size only on late 3/3 lock

**Clues**: Range D-Day early (rotational), then acceptance + DPOC migration post-12:30/14:00. Often after Range D-Day fails.

**Bias**: Directional lock late (watch London-close window)

**Entry Model**:

* Trigger: Final-hour breakout acceptance + volume
* Entry: Retest of breakout level (IBH/IBL or VWAP)

**Stops**:

* Back inside prior balance

**Targets**:

1. Measured late leg (common +200–400 pts)
2. Weekly extreme

**Notes**: Patience AM — real move often final 90 min. **No PM Morph Filter**: If trend strength is **Weak** or a major HVN/LVN is in the way, assume no morph.
**Caution Call-out**: Failed late breakout (rejection back into balance) = immediate flat. **Stand down triggers**: Unclear late acceptance or reversal TPO = hands under lap.

---

### 9. Balanced Day Morph to Trend Day

**Lanto Gate**: Full size only on morph trigger + 3/3

**Clues**: Early P/B-day → single prints + fattening + extreme DPOC migration (>160 pts into VAH/VAL). Meets rigid 5/5 checklist post-morph (all required for true Trend Day call): ≥80% RTH outside IB range; ≥3 consecutive 30-min periods fully outside IB + monotonic DPOC migration; ≥4 consecutive 30/60-min candles one-timeframing (higher/lower highs/lows); elongated thin TPO profile with fattening only at directional extreme; ≥70% RTH outside prior day’s Value Area.

**Bias**: Directional lock on morph trigger

**Entry Model**:

* Resolution: DPOC migration/compressing into VAH/VAL + acceptance
* Entry: Pullback to new support (VWAP, emerging dPOC)

**Stops**:

* Back into prior balance area

**Targets**:

1. Next HVN/LVN
2. Measured move from morph trigger
3. Weekly extension

**Notes**: Highest conviction on extreme migration + wick parade stack. 5/5 = 95–100% confidence (MAX conviction, full pyramid); 4/5 = Trend-Day Morph (full size OK, trail tighter); 3/5 or less = Strong Directional / P-Day with extension (half size max, fade edges possible).
**The Failure Trigger**: If price trades back through the new DPOC during a mid-PM attempt to extend, the morph has failed. **Immediately Flat**.
**Caution Call-out**: Stalling DPOC or opposite wick parade ≥6 = abort morph call. **Stand down triggers**: Any ambiguity in morph confirmation = hands under lap.
