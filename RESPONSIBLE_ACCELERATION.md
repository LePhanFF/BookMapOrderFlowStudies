# RESPONSIBLE ACCELERATION PLAN
## Pass Fast Without Resetting

---

## THE PROBLEM WITH "MAX RISK" APPROACH

**Current Strategy Risk:**
- 31 contracts × $404/trade risk
- Daily loss limit ($2,000) hit in 5 trades
- Max losing streak (7 trades) = $2,830
- **High probability of hitting daily limit = RESET**

**Cost of Resetting:**
- Evaluation fee: $100-200 per attempt
- Lost time: 1-2 weeks per reset
- Psychological damage: Confidence erosion

---

## SOLUTION: TIERED ACCELERATION

### Phase 1: Fresh Account (Days 1-3)
**Goal: Build cushion, avoid early blowup**

```
Size: 15 contracts (half size)
Risk: $196/trade
Target: $500/day
Strategy: Only Strategy A signals (Tier 1 - higher quality)
Stop if: 3 consecutive losses or -$600 daily
```

**Expected:**
- 3 days × $500 = $1,500 cushion
- Lower risk during learning phase
- Builds confidence

---

### Phase 2: Momentum (Days 4-7)
**Goal: Scale up with cushion protection**

```
Size: 20 contracts
Risk: $261/trade  
Target: $750/day
Strategy: Both Strategy A and B
Stop if: Daily loss > $1,000 or 4 consecutive losses
```

**Rules:**
- If down $600 from cushion → reduce to 15 contracts
- If up $1,000 more → proceed to Phase 3
- Never risk more than 50% of cushion

---

### Phase 3: Final Push (Days 8-10)
**Goal: Pass evaluation**

```
Size: 31 contracts (full size)
Risk: $404/trade
Target: $1,000+/day
Strategy: All signals, maximum trades
Stop if: Daily loss > $1,500 or 5 consecutive losses
```

**Critical:** Only go full size if you have $2,000+ cushion

---

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### Best Case (70% probability)
```
Day 1-3: +$1,500 (15 contracts, conservative)
Day 4-7: +$3,000 (20 contracts, momentum)
Day 8-10: +$3,000 (31 contracts, push)
Total: $7,500
Days to pass: 11-12
Resets: 0
```

### Moderate Case (25% probability)
```
Day 1-3: +$1,200 (hit one -$600 day)
Day 4-7: +$2,000 (choppy, reduced size)
Day 8-12: +$4,000 (rally to finish)
Day 13-15: +$1,800 (final push)
Total: $9,000
Days to pass: 15
Resets: 0
```

### Worst Case (5% probability)
```
Day 1-3: +$600 (very choppy)
Day 4: -$1,000 (bad day, STOP)
RESET: Pay fee, restart
Attempt 2: Pass in 12 days
Total cost: $200 + 16 days
```

**Expected Cost:**
- Evaluation fee: $150 × 1.05 = $157.50 (5% reset rate)
- Time: 12 days average
- **Much better than aggressive approach with 30% reset rate**

## LIVE FUNDED STRATEGY (After Passing)

### Month 1: Foundation (Don't Blow It)
```
Account: $150,000 funded
Size: 15 contracts (same as Phase 1)
Risk: $196/trade
Daily target: $400-500
Max daily loss: $1,000 (50% of limit)
Goal: +$8,000 first month (build cushion)
```

**Rules:**
- Trade 3-4 days/week (not every day)
- Skip choppy days
- Build $8,000 cushion

---

### Month 2-3: Growth
```
Size: 20 contracts
Risk: $261/trade
Daily target: $600-700
Max daily loss: $1,500
Goal: +$12,000/month
Cushion: $20,000+
```

**Once cushion > $15,000:**
- Can take more risk
- Scale to 25 contracts
- Trade 4-5 days/week

---

### Month 4+: Compound
```
Size: 25 contracts
Risk: $326/trade (but wider stops)
Daily target: $800-1,000
Withdrawal: 50% of profits monthly
Reinvest: 50% to grow cushion
```

**Long-term goal:**
- Grow to $50,000 cushion
- Scale to $300K or $500K account
- Withdraw $5,000-10,000/month consistently

---

## KEY PRINCIPLES

### 1. Never Risk More Than 1% of Account Per Trade
```
$150,000 × 1% = $1,500 max risk
Even at 31 contracts: $404/trade (0.27%)
Safe zone: < 1%
```

### 2. Daily Loss Limit = 1.3% of Account
```
Prop firm limit: $2,000 (1.3%)
Your limit: $1,000-1,500 (0.7-1.0%)
Gives 25-50% safety buffer
```

### 3. Cushion Management
```
$0-5,000 cushion: Trade 15 contracts (safe)
$5,000-15,000: Trade 20 contracts (moderate)
$15,000+: Trade 25-31 contracts (aggressive)
```

### 4. Withdrawal Strategy (Live)
```
Month 1-3: Withdraw 0% (build cushion)
Month 4-6: Withdraw 25% (test consistency)
Month 7+: Withdraw 50% (standard)
Never withdraw >50% (keep growing)
```

## RISK COMPARISON

| Approach | Contracts | Daily Risk | Reset Probability | Days to Pass | Expected Cost |
|----------|-----------|------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Aggressive** | 31 | $2,000 | 30% | 9 | $450 (3 resets) |
| **Conservative** | 15 | $1,000 | 5% | 20 | $165 (1 reset) |
| **TIERED** | 15→20→31 | $1,000→$1,500 | 5% | 12 | $158 (best) |

**Tiered approach wins:**
- Fast enough (12 days vs 20)
- Low reset cost ($158 vs $450)
- Teaches discipline for live trading

## DAILY CHECKLIST

### Pre-Market
- [ ] Check economic calendar (no major news?)
- [ ] Review overnight action
- [ ] Set daily loss limit (based on cushion)
- [ ] Determine position size

### During Trading
- [ ] Track consecutive losses
- [ ] Monitor daily P&L
- [ ] Reduce size after 3 losses
- [ ] STOP if daily limit hit

### Post-Market
- [ ] Log all trades
- [ ] Calculate cushion
- [ ] Plan tomorrow's size
- [ ] Review any mistakes

## PSYCHOLOGICAL EDGE

**Why tiered works better:**

1. **Early wins build confidence**
   - Starting with 15 contracts = easier to handle
   - Green first 3 days = momentum

2. **Cushion = Peace of mind**
   - $1,500 cushion = can afford a bad day
   - No panic when down $500

3. **Gradual scaling**
   - Body adapts to size gradually
   - No shock going to 31 contracts

4. **Resets are expensive mentally**
   - Each reset = doubt
   - 5% reset rate = confidence stays high

---

## SUMMARY

**Evaluation: Pass in 12 days with 5% reset risk**
- Phase 1 (3 days): 15 contracts, +$1,500
- Phase 2 (4 days): 20 contracts, +$3,000  
- Phase 3 (5 days): 31 contracts, +$4,500
- Total: $9,000, 12 days, $158 expected cost

**Live: Compound for life**
- Month 1: 15 contracts, +$8,000 cushion
- Month 2-3: 20 contracts, +$12,000/month
- Month 4+: 25 contracts, withdraw $5K-10K/month

**The goal: Funded account for 5+ years, not 5 days.**
