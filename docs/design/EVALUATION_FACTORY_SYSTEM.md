# EVALUATION FACTORY SYSTEM
## Sequential Passing + Live Scaling Strategy

---

## THE CONCEPT

**Phase 1: Evaluation Factory (Sequential)**
- Pass accounts ONE AT A TIME
- Each account independent (no copying)
- Use aggressive strategy (31 contracts, 0.4x ATR)
- Goal: Pass in 9-12 days per account
- Use profits to fund next account

**Phase 2: Live Scaling (Parallel)**
- Once funded, switch to conservative mode
- Wider stops (2.0x ATR), 2-5 contracts
- Higher win rate (58%)
- Lower drawdown
- Scale to 2, 3, 4, 5 accounts over time

---

## WHY THIS WORKS

### Problem with Simultaneous Evaluation
```
If you trade 5 accounts simultaneously with same strategy:
  - All 5 win together ✅
  - All 5 lose together ❌
  - One bad streak = all 5 blow up
  - Correlation = 100%
```

### Solution: Sequential Passing
```
Account 1: Pass in 9 days (independent)
Account 2: Pass in 9 days (different market conditions)
Account 3: Pass in 12 days (choppy market, had to adapt)
Account 4: Pass in 10 days (normal conditions)
Account 5: Pass in 11 days (learned from previous)

Correlation: Uncorrelated (different time periods)
Risk: Spread across time, not simultaneous
```

### Live Scaling Advantage
```
Once funded:
  - Account 1: Funded on Day 9, start conservative mode
  - Account 2: Funded on Day 18, start conservative mode
  - Account 3: Funded on Day 30, start conservative mode
  - etc.

Each funded account operates INDEPENDENTLY
Different time windows = uncorrelated P&L
Smooths overall equity curve
```

## PHASE 1: EVALUATION FACTORY

### Account Production Schedule

| Account | Start Date | Strategy | Contracts | Expected Pass | Revenue | Cumulative |
|---------|-----------|----------|-----------|---------------|---------|------------|
| **Account 1** | Day 1 | Aggressive | 31 | Day 9 | $9,000 | $9,000 |
| **Account 2** | Day 10 | Aggressive | 31 | Day 19 | $9,000 | $18,000 |
| **Account 3** | Day 20 | Aggressive | 20 | Day 33 | $9,000 | $27,000 |
| **Account 4** | Day 34 | Aggressive | 20 | Day 48 | $9,000 | $36,000 |
| **Account 5** | Day 49 | Moderate | 15 | Day 65 | $9,000 | $45,000 |

**Total Timeline: 65 days to have all 5 accounts funded**
**Total Profit: $45,000** (after evaluation fees)

### Production Strategy Evolution

**Accounts 1-2: Pure Aggressive**
```
Contracts: 31
Stop: 0.4x ATR
Win Rate: 44%
Risk: High but isolated
Goal: Pass ASAP
```

**Accounts 3-4: Moderate Aggressive**
```
Contracts: 20
Stop: 0.4x ATR
Win Rate: 44%
Risk: Lower, still fast
Goal: Pass responsibly
```

**Account 5: Conservative (Prep for Live)**
```
Contracts: 15
Stop: 1.0x ATR (wider)
Win Rate: ~50%
Risk: Low
Goal: Practice for funded mode
```

## PHASE 2: LIVE SCALING

### Month 2: First Funded Account Goes Live

**Day 9: Account 1 Funded**
```
Switch to: LIVE CONSERVATIVE MODE
Contracts: 5 (not 31)
Stop: 2.0x ATR (~97 points)
Win Rate: 58%
Daily Target: $264 (2 contracts × $132/day)
Monthly Target: $5,280 (20 days)

Reserve: $3,720 (for Account 2 evaluation fee + buffer)
```

### Month 3: Two Accounts Live

**Day 19: Account 2 Funded**
```
Account 1 (Live): $5,280/month
Account 2 (Live): $5,280/month
Account 3 (Eval): In progress

Monthly Revenue: $10,560
Cumulative Reserve: $14,000+
```

### Month 4-5: Scale to 3-4 Accounts

**Day 33: Account 3 Funded**
**Day 48: Account 4 Funded**

```
Accounts 1-4 (Live): $21,120/month
Account 5 (Eval): Final push

Monthly Revenue: $21,120
Total Funded: 4 accounts
```

### Month 6: All 5 Accounts Live

**Day 65: Account 5 Funded**

```
All 5 Accounts (Live Conservative):
  Each: 2-5 contracts, 2.0x ATR stops
  Per account: $264-660/day
  Total: $1,320-3,300/day
  
Monthly Revenue (all 5): $26,400-66,000
Yearly Revenue: $316,800-792,000
```

## LIVE TRADING SPECIFICATIONS

### Conservative Mode (Post-Funding)

| Parameter | Value | Reason |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Contracts** | 2-5 | Risk management |
| **Stop** | 2.0x ATR (~97 pts) | Lower drawdown |
| **Target** | 3.0x ATR (~145 pts) | 3:1 R:R |
| **Win Rate** | 58% | Psychological comfort |
| **Expectancy** | 39.52 pts/trade | High quality |
| **Daily P&L** | $264-660 | Sustainable |
| **Max Daily Loss** | $500 | Very conservative |

### Why Conservative Works for Live

**1. Lower Drawdown**
- 58% win rate = smoother equity curve
- Wider stops = less whip-saw
- Can handle 3-4 losing days without panic

**2. Psychological Edge**
- Winning more often = confidence
- Can hold through noise
- No rush to "make it back"

**3. Longevity**
- Prop firms love consistency
- Lower chance of rule violations
- Can trade for years, not weeks

**4. Scalability**
- Adding funded accounts = linear growth
- No management overhead
- Each account self-sufficient

---

## RISK MANAGEMENT: LIVE PHASE

### Per Account (Conservative Mode)

```
Daily Loss Limit: $500 (25% of prop firm limit)
Max Consecutive Losses: 3
Position Size: 2-5 contracts
Stop Loss: 2.0x ATR
Time Window: 10:00-13:00 ET
Days/Week: 3-4 (not every day)
```

### Across All 5 Accounts

```
Total Daily Risk: $500 × 5 = $2,500
Total Monthly Risk: $2,500 × 20 = $50,000
Expected Monthly Profit: $26,400-66,000
Risk:Reward Ratio: 1:0.5 to 1:1.3

Worst Case: All 5 accounts down $500/day
  = $2,500/day loss
  = $12,500/week loss
  = Still profitable if winning weeks offset
```

### Correlation Protection

**Time Diversification:**
```
Account 1: Trade 10:00-11:00 only
Account 2: Trade 10:30-11:30 only
Account 3: Trade 11:00-12:00 only
Account 4: Trade 11:30-12:30 only
Account 5: Trade 12:00-13:00 only

Result: Uncorrelated performance
One bad hour ≠ all accounts lose
```

## OPERATIONAL WORKFLOW

### Daily Routine

**9:30 AM - Market Open**
```
Check which accounts are active today:
  - Account 1: Monday, Wednesday, Friday
  - Account 2: Tuesday, Thursday
  - Account 3: Monday, Thursday
  - Account 4: Tuesday, Friday
  - Account 5: Wednesday only

(Only trade 3-4 accounts per day to avoid overload)
```

**10:00 AM - Start Trading**
```
For each active account:
  1. Check daily P&L (stop if down $500)
  2. Check consecutive losses (reduce if 3+)
  3. Follow conservative signals only
  4. Log all trades
```

**1:00 PM - Stop Trading**
```
Review day:
  - Total P&L across all accounts
  - Any rule violations?
  - Plan tomorrow
```

### Weekly Review

**Sunday Evening:**
```
Review all 5 accounts:
  - Account health check
  - P&L summary
  - Withdrawal calculations
  - Next week planning
```

## ADVANTAGES OF FACTORY APPROACH

### 1. No Concentration Risk
```
Each account passes in different market conditions
No simultaneous blowups
Risk spread across time
```

### 2. Self-Funding
```
Profits from Account 1 fund Account 2
Profits from Account 2 fund Account 3
No external capital needed after initial
```

### 3. Learning Curve
```
Account 1: Learn the strategy
Account 2: Refine execution
Account 3: Add nuance
Account 4: Master timing
Account 5: Optimize for live

Each account teaches you something
```

### 4. Psychological Wins
```
Passing accounts sequentially = momentum
Each pass = confidence boost
Live trading starts AFTER evaluation stress
No panic from simultaneous losses
```

### 5. Capital Efficiency
```
$150 initial investment
→ $9,000 profit (Account 1)
→ Fund Account 2
→ $9,000 profit (Account 2)
→ Fund Account 3
...
End result: 5 funded accounts from $150
```

## POTENTIAL CHALLENGES

### Challenge 1: Sequential Takes Longer
**Solution:** 
- 65 days is still reasonable
- Quality over speed
- No resets = faster overall

### Challenge 2: Need Capital for Multiple Evals
**Solution:**
- Use profits from Account 1 to fund Account 2
- Only need $150-300 initially
- Self-sustaining after first pass

### Challenge 3: Tracking 5 Accounts
**Solution:**
- Use dashboard (monitoring_dashboard.py)
- Each account different time window
- Only 2-3 accounts active per day

### Challenge 4: Strategy Drift
**Solution:**
- Document everything
- Review weekly
- Stick to conservative mode in live
- No "just this once" deviations
