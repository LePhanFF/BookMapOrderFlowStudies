# 142-Session Full Validation Report
**Date**: 2026-02-19
**Data Range**: Aug 4, 2025 - Feb 19, 2026 (142 sessions)
**Comparison**: 62-session in-sample (Nov 18 2025 - Feb 16 2026) vs full 142-session OOS

## Executive Summary

The 7-strategy portfolio shows significant **curve-fitting degradation** when tested on the full 142-session dataset vs the 62-session report window. Three strategies (B-Day, P-Day, Trend Day Bull) lose 19-50% WR out-of-sample. Root cause: hardcoded point-based thresholds tuned to Nov-Feb high-volatility regime.

## Curve Fitting Analysis

### Hardcoded Point-Based Constants (Curve Fitting Risk)

| Strategy | Constant | Value | Problem |
|----------|----------|-------|---------|
| B-Day | `BDAY_MAX_IB_RANGE` | 400 pts | Rarely hit outside Nov-Feb; too permissive in high-vol |
| Trend Bull | `COMPRESSED_IB_THRESHOLD` | 50 pts | Fixed threshold ignores market context |
| Trend Bull | `STOP_MINIMUM_PTS` | 15 pts | Doesn't scale with IB volatility |
| Trend Bull/P-Day | `pre_delta_momentum` | -500 | Fixed delta threshold; in low-vol months delta ranges are smaller |
| OR Reversal | `SWEEP_THRESHOLD_PTS` | 20 pts | 20 pts = 67% of a 30-pt IB vs 13% of 150-pt IB |
| OR Reversal | `VWAP_ALIGNED_PTS` | 20 pts | Same scaling issue |
| OR Reversal | `MAX_RISK_PTS` | 200 pts | Caps out regardless of IB size |
| IBH Sweep | `IBH_SWEEP_MIN_PTS` | 5 pts | Tiny threshold, noise-sensitive |
| IBH Sweep | `PDH_PROXIMITY` | 10 pts | Fixed proximity regardless of range |
| IBH Sweep | `MAX_IB_RANGE` | 300 pts | Same issue as B-Day |
| Config | `VWAP_BREACH_POINTS` | 10 pts | Fixed across all regimes |

### Ratio-Based Constants (Sound Design)

These already scale with IB range and need no changes:
- Edge Fade: `EDGE_ZONE_PCT=0.25`, `EDGE_STOP_BUFFER=0.15`, expansion filter `1.2x`
- All stop/target buffers expressed as IB fractions (0.15, 0.25, 0.40, 0.50)
- Day type classification thresholds (0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0x extension)

## Root Cause: Volatility Regime Shift

The Nov-Feb window (in-sample) was a **high-volatility regime**:
- Average IB range: ~200-400 pts
- Large directional moves, strong trends
- Hardcoded thresholds of 15-50 pts were proportionally small

The Aug-Sep period (OOS) was a **low-volatility regime**:
- Average IB range: ~80-150 pts
- Choppy, mean-reverting price action
- Same 15-50 pt thresholds became proportionally large, causing false signals

## Proposed Fixes (Priority Order)

### Priority 1: B-Day, Trend Bull, P-Day (most degradation)
- Replace `BDAY_MAX_IB_RANGE=400` with rolling percentile-based cap
- Replace `pre_delta_momentum=-500` with IB-scaled or rolling-median threshold
- Replace `STOP_MINIMUM_PTS=15` and `COMPRESSED_IB_THRESHOLD=50` with IB-relative values

### Priority 2: OR Reversal
- Replace `SWEEP_THRESHOLD_PTS=20` with `ib_range * 0.13` (~20/150)
- Replace `VWAP_ALIGNED_PTS=20` with `ib_range * 0.13`
- Replace `MAX_RISK_PTS=200` with `ib_range * 1.3`

### Priority 3: IBH Sweep, Config
- Replace `IBH_SWEEP_MIN_PTS=5` with `ib_range * 0.03`
- Replace `VWAP_BREACH_POINTS=10` with `ib_range * 0.07`

### No Change Needed
- Edge Fade (already adaptive, best OOS stability)
- IBH Sweep logic (small sample, but improved OOS)
