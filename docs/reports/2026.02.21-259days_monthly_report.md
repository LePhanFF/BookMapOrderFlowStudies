## 7. Trade Management Study Summary

A comprehensive bar-by-bar trade management study was conducted (13 configurations x 7 strategies). Key findings:

| Strategy | Best Config | Improvement |
|---|---|---|
| **OR Reversal** | Trail@0.75R | +$1,793 (1-contract) |
| **Edge Fade** | BE@0.75R | +$482 (1-contract) |
| B-Day | BASELINE (fixed) | No improvement |
| Bear Accept | BASELINE (fixed) | No improvement |
| P-Day | Trail@0.5R | +$100 (marginal) |
| Trend Bull | BE@0.3+Trail@0.5 | +$109 (marginal) |

**CRITICAL FINDING:** When implemented in the engine with risk-based contract sizing, trail/BE management REGRESSED total P&L from $19,462 to $13,986. Root cause: trail stops cut the right tail of big winners, and risk-based sizing allocates fewer contracts to high-risk (wide-stop) trades where MFE is highest. The baseline fixed stop/target is optimal for the current sizing model.

The infrastructure code (peak MFE tracking, R-based trailing, breakeven-at-R) remains in `engine/position.py` for future use with partial exits or adaptive management.

## 8. Strategy Health Assessment

| Strategy | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| OR Reversal | STRONG | Star performer. $215/trade, PF 3.34. Works in all regimes. |
| Edge Fade | STRONG | Workhorse. 96 trades, consistent. Dec 2025 was exceptional. |
| B-Day | MARGINAL | Barely positive ($758). High MFE (5.3R) wasted on choppy moves. |
| P-Day | WEAK | Negative over full year. Only works Nov-Feb (high vol). |
| Trend Day Bull | WEAK | Negative over full year. VWAP lag kills entries on real trend days. |
| Bear Accept | REMOVE? | -$2,553 despite 67% WR. Inverted R:R is structural. |
| IBH Sweep | DISABLED | Needs HTF confluence data. Only 1 trade without it. |

### Recommended Core Portfolio
If trimming to only profitable strategies:
- **OR Reversal + Edge Fade only**: 161 trades, ~$22,396 net (removes -$2,891 drag from weak strats)
- Keep B-Day as marginal contributor ($758)
- Drop Bear Accept, P-Day, Trend Bull for live trading

## 9. Actionable Next Steps

1. **Fix Trend Bull VWAP alignment** — use VWAP slope instead of proximity (recover 9+ sessions/year)
2. **Fix Bear Accept R:R** — widen targets to 1.0x IB or drop strategy entirely
3. **Explore partial exits** — trail stops hurt with full-position sizing but could work with 50% partials
4. **VIX-scaled position sizing** — high vol (>250 IB) produces 62% of P&L; optimize sizing per regime
5. **NinjaTrader export** — focus on OR Reversal + Edge Fade for live deployment
