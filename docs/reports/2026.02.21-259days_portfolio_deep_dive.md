## Section 2: Per-Strategy Risk, Expectancy & Win Rate

| Strategy | Trades | Wins | WR | Net P&L | $/trade | Avg Risk | Avg Win R | Avg Loss R | Expect R | PF |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B-Day | 19 | 8 | 42.1% | $758 | $40 | 29pt | +1.43R | -0.94R | +0.68R | 1.19 |
| Bear Accept | 58 | 39 | 67.2% | -$2,553 | -$44 | 138pt | +0.26R | -0.85R | -0.16R | 0.56 |
| Edge Fade | 96 | 54 | 56.2% | $8,434 | $88 | 58pt | +0.82R | -0.96R | +0.75R | 1.62 |
| IBH Sweep | 1 | 0 | 0.0% | -$37 | -$37 | 71pt | +0.00R | -0.12R | -0.26R | 0.00 |
| **OR Reversal** | **65** | **40** | **61.5%** | **$13,962** | **$215** | **66pt** | **+0.91R** | **-0.72R** | **+1.63R** | **3.34** |
| P-Day | 23 | 8 | 34.8% | -$514 | -$22 | 56pt | +0.02R | -0.50R | -0.20R | 0.77 |
| Trend Bull | 21 | 8 | 38.1% | -$589 | -$28 | 54pt | +0.04R | -0.49R | -0.26R | 0.67 |

### Key Observations
- **OR Reversal** is the only strategy with favorable R:R (1.27 win/loss ratio)
- **Bear Accept** has worst R:R (0.30 ratio) -- structural problem, targets too small
- **P-Day and Trend Bull** have near-zero R on winners (+0.02R, +0.04R) -- win only via EOD grind exits, never hit target

## Section 3: Profit Distribution

### P&L Percentiles
| Percentile | Value |
|---|---|
| 5th | -$395 |
| 10th | -$376 |
| 25th | -$288 |
| **50th (Median)** | **$53** |
| 75th | $312 |
| 90th | $642 |
| 95th | $711 |

**Std Dev:** $377 | **Skewness:** 0.68 (positive -- fat right tail)

### P&L Histogram
```
$-2,000 to $-1,000:   0
$-1,000 to $  -500:   0
$  -500 to $  -250:  81 ########################################
$  -250 to $  -100:  23 ###########
$  -100 to $     0:  22 ##########
$     0 to $   100:  47 #######################
$   100 to $   250:  29 ##############
$   250 to $   500:  34 ################
$   500 to $ 1,000:  45 ######################
$ 1,000 to $ 2,000:   2
$ 2,000 to $ 5,000:   0
```

**Key insight:** 81 trades cluster at -$250 to -$500 (full stop losses). No trade worse than -$439 -- risk is well-capped. The 45 trades in the $500-$1,000 bucket are the profit engine.

### R-Multiple Distribution
```
-1.5R to -1.0R:  88 #############################
-1.0R to -0.5R:  12 ####
-0.5R to  0.0R:  12 ####
 0.0R to +0.5R: 118 ########################################
+0.5R to +1.0R:   3 #
+1.0R to +1.5R:  19 ######
+1.5R to +2.0R:  22 #######
+2.0R to +3.0R:   8 ##
+3.0R to +5.0R:   1
```

**Bimodal distribution:** Trades either lose -1R (full stop) or win small (+0 to +0.5R). The 50 trades above +1R drive all profits.

### Per-Strategy P&L Spread (P5 / P25 / Median / P75 / P95)
| Strategy | P5 | P25 | Median | P75 | P95 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B-Day | -$424 | -$402 | -$313 | $331 | $1,045 |
| Bear Accept | -$368 | -$235 | $60 | $92 | $118 |
| Edge Fade | -$390 | -$344 | $99 | $402 | $718 |
| **OR Reversal** | **-$361** | **-$209** | **$229** | **$652** | **$745** |
| P-Day | -$384 | -$219 | -$3 | $87 | $299 |
| Trend Bull | -$320 | -$209 | -$3 | $83 | $247 |

## Section 4: Target Comparison (1R, 1.5R, 2R, 3R vs Trailing)

### Portfolio-Level
| Config | Trades | Wins | WR | Net P&L | $/trade |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ACTUAL (current)** | **283** | **157** | **55.5%** | **$19,462** | **$69** |
| Fixed 1.0R | 283 | 153 | 54.1% | $15,308 | $54 |
| Fixed 1.5R | 283 | 136 | 48.1% | $15,709 | $56 |
| Fixed 2.0R | 283 | 134 | 47.3% | $17,021 | $60 |
| Fixed 3.0R | 283 | 127 | 44.9% | $16,863 | $60 |
| Trail@0.5R | 283 | 175 | 61.8% | $17,651 | $62 |
| Trail@0.75R | 283 | 160 | 56.5% | $17,511 | $62 |
| Trail@1.0R | 283 | 150 | 53.0% | $16,271 | $57 |

**The current mixed target system BEATS all uniform alternatives by $1,800+.** Strategy-specific R:R is already optimal.

### Per-Strategy Comparison (Net P&L)
| Config | B-Day | Bear Acc | Edge Fade | IBH Swp | OR Rev | P-Day | Trd Bull | TOTAL |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ACTUAL** | **$758** | **-$2,553** | **$8,434** | **-$37** | **$13,962** | **-$514** | **-$589** | **$19,462** |
| Fixed 1.0R | $666 | -$2,446 | $7,165 | -$146 | $9,598 | $679 | -$209 | $15,308 |
| Fixed 1.5R | $460 | -$1,814 | $6,909 | -$146 | $10,043 | $465 | -$209 | $15,709 |
| Fixed 2.0R | $662 | -$2,540 | $8,489 | -$146 | $10,299 | $465 | -$209 | $17,021 |
| Fixed 3.0R | $869 | -$2,058 | $7,931 | -$146 | $10,009 | $465 | -$209 | $16,863 |
| Trail@0.5R | $399 | -$2,394 | $7,668 | -$146 | $11,688 | $566 | -$130 | $17,651 |
| Trail@0.75R | $369 | -$2,651 | $7,574 | -$146 | $12,065 | $508 | -$209 | $17,511 |
| Trail@1.0R | $446 | -$2,086 | $6,489 | -$146 | $11,325 | $451 | -$209 | $16,271 |

**OR Reversal loses the most from fixed targets** ($13,962 actual vs $9,598 at 1.0R). Its strategy-specific management captures big moves that uniform targets miss.

## Section 5: Monthly Deep Dive - Regime, Sessions, Key Findings

### 2025-02 -- PROFIT ($1,756)
- Sessions: 6/7 traded | Trades: 19 | WR: 47%
- Avg IB: 271 pts | Regime: HIGH:8, NORMAL:11
- **OR Rev carried** (3t, 100% WR, $2,143). Edge Fade busy (11t) but only 45% WR.
- B-Day/P-Day/Trend Bull each took 1 trade, all losers.

### 2025-03 -- LOSS (-$746) ***
- Sessions: 18/21 traded | Trades: 36 | WR: 42%
- Avg IB: 236 pts | Regime: HIGH:17, NORMAL:17
- **PRIMARY DRAG: B-Day (-$1,191)** -- 3 trades, 0% WR, all full stops
- P-Day (-$566) and Trend Bull (-$526) also 20% WR
- OR Rev ($996) and Edge Fade ($896) couldn't overcome the drag
- **Root cause:** B-Day takes small IB breakouts with tight stops; in Mar 2025 choppy action, all 3 reversed through stop

### 2025-04 -- PROFIT ($172)
- Sessions: 15/21 traded | Trades: 25 | WR: 44%
- Avg IB: 240 pts | Regime: HIGH:11, NORMAL:14
- OR Rev carried again ($1,617, 100% WR)
- B-Day (-$786, 0% WR) and Trend Bull (-$329, 0% WR) continued bleeding

- **PRIMARY DRAG: Edge Fade (-$1,093)** -- 4 of 5 trades hit full stop
- Bear Accept also dragged (-$850)
- OR Rev saved the month ($2,614, 100% WR)
- **Root cause:** Transitional vol regime (IB dropping from HIGH to MED/LOW). Edge Fade entries triggered but moves failed to develop.

- Sessions: 7/21 traded | Trades: 10 | WR: 40%
- Avg IB: 128 pts | Regime: LOW:4, MED:4
- **ROOT CAUSE: LOW volatility.** Only 7 of 21 sessions triggered any trade.
- B-Day/P-Day/Trend Bull regime-gated (1 trade each, all losers)
- OR Rev also failed (2t, 0% WR, -$582)
- **Not enough opportunity** -- system is designed for higher vol

### 2025-07 -- PROFIT ($123)
- Sessions: 13/23 traded | Trades: 16 | WR: 56%
- Avg IB: 123 pts | Regime: LOW:6, MED:8
- B-Day/P-Day/Trend Bull = 0 trades (regime gates)
- OR Rev carried (9t, 56% WR, $940)

- OR Rev carried ($686, 100% WR, but only 2 trades)
- Bear Accept (-$207) and Edge Fade (-$324) dragged

### 2025-11 -- PROFIT ($808)
- Sessions: 14/20 traded | Trades: 31 | WR: 52%

## Section 6: Strategy Weakness Analysis

### B-Day (19 trades, $758)
- **Direction:** LONG only (19t, 42% WR)
- **Max Loss Streak:** 8
- **By Regime:** HIGH $1,012 | MED $584 | NORMAL -$399 | LOW -$439
- **By Exit:** TARGET $3,200 | VWAP_BREACH $1,487 | STOP -$3,929
- **R:R:** +1.43R avg win vs -0.94R avg loss (ratio 1.52 -- GOOD)
- **WEAKNESSES:** Low WR (42%), long loss streaks (8), loses in NORMAL/LOW vol
- **Assessment:** R:R is actually good when it wins. Problem is frequency -- too many full stops in choppy/low-vol conditions.

### Bear Accept (58 trades, -$2,553)
- **Direction:** SHORT only (58t, 67% WR)
- **Max Loss Streak:** 3
- **By Regime:** HIGH $7 | MED -$85 | NORMAL -$1,179 | LOW -$1,296
- **By Exit:** TARGET $3,116 | STOP -$4,172 | EOD -$814 | VWAP -$682
- **R:R:** +0.26R avg win vs -0.85R avg loss (ratio 0.30 -- TERRIBLE)
- **WEAKNESSES:** NEGATIVE P&L, inverted R:R, loses in NORMAL and LOW vol
- **Assessment:** Structural R:R problem. Wins are tiny ($53 avg), losses are large ($347 avg). 67% WR can't compensate.

### Edge Fade (96 trades, $8,434)
- **Direction:** LONG only (96t, 56% WR)
- **Max Loss Streak:** 5
- **By Regime:** HIGH $4,550 | NORMAL $4,936 | MED -$1,052
- **By Exit:** TARGET $20,802 | EOD $1,320 | STOP -$13,687
- **R:R:** +0.82R avg win vs -0.96R avg loss (ratio 0.86 -- slightly inverted)
- **WEAKNESSES:** Inverted R:R, loss streaks of 5, loses in MED vol
- **Assessment:** Compensates for inverted R:R with volume and slight WR edge. Vulnerable in MED vol where moves don't develop. TARGET hits ($20,802) overwhelm STOP losses ($13,687).

### OR Reversal (65 trades, $13,962) -- STAR
- **Direction:** LONG 29t 48% WR $2,567 | SHORT 36t 72% WR $11,395
- **Max Loss Streak:** 4
- **By Regime:** HIGH $6,776 | MED $3,707 | NORMAL $3,546 | LOW -$68
- **By Exit:** TARGET $15,459 | EOD $3,884 | VWAP -$848 | STOP -$4,533
- **R:R:** +0.91R avg win vs -0.72R avg loss (ratio 1.27 -- FAVORABLE)
- **WEAKNESSES:** Loss streaks of 4, LONG side underperforms (48% WR vs 72% SHORT)
- **Assessment:** Best strategy overall. SHORT side dominant. Works across all regimes except LOW vol. Only weakness is LONG entries -- consider SHORT-only mode.

### P-Day (23 trades, -$514)
- **Direction:** LONG only (23t, 35% WR)
- **Max Loss Streak:** 7
- **By Regime:** MED $281 | HIGH -$99 | LOW -$175 | NORMAL -$520
- **By Exit:** EOD $1,735 | VWAP -$737 | STOP -$1,511
- **R:R:** +0.02R avg win vs -0.50R avg loss (ratio 0.04 -- NEAR ZERO)
- **WEAKNESSES:** Low WR (35%), negative P&L, near-zero R on wins, 7 consecutive losses
- **Assessment:** Winners come ONLY from EOD exits (grinding $8-$15/trade). Never hits target. Fundamentally a momentum-following strategy that enters too late and gets stopped.

### Trend Bull (21 trades, -$589)
- **Direction:** LONG only (21t, 38% WR)
- **Max Loss Streak:** 7
- **By Regime:** MED $281 | HIGH -$99 | LOW -$99 | NORMAL -$671
- **By Exit:** EOD $1,090 | STOP -$1,679
- **R:R:** +0.04R avg win vs -0.49R avg loss (ratio 0.07 -- NEAR ZERO)
- **WEAKNESSES:** Low WR (38%), negative P&L, near-zero R on wins, 7 consecutive losses, loses in NORMAL vol
- **Assessment:** Same problem as P-Day. VWAP alignment kills entries on real trend days. Winners are tiny EOD grinders.

## Section 7: Drawdown Analysis & Position Sizing

### Equity Curve
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Final Equity | $19,462 |
| Peak Equity | $19,462 |
| Max Drawdown | $3,334 |
| DD Period | Nov 4 - Dec 3, 2025 |
| Max Consecutive Losses | 8 |

Equity curve ends at all-time high.

### Significant Drawdowns (>$500)
| Depth | Period |
|---|---|
| $3,334 | Nov 4 - Dec 3, 2025 |
| $3,135 | Feb 26 - Aug 20, 2025 |
| $1,859 | Feb 21 - Feb 25, 2025 |
| $1,198 | Feb 3 - Feb 11, 2026 |
| $1,168 | Oct 15 - Nov 3, 2025 |
| $1,072 | Dec 30 - Jan 13, 2026 |

The Feb-Aug 2025 drawdown ($3,135) lasted 6 months but was shallow -- just grinding sideways during low-vol summer.

### Daily P&L
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Trading Days | 154 |
| Winning Days | 88 (57%) |
| Losing Days | 66 (43%) |
| Avg Winning Day | $538 |
| Avg Losing Day | -$423 |
| Best Day | $2,611 |
| Worst Day | -$1,779 |

### Monte Carlo Drawdown (10,000 shuffles)
| Percentile | Max DD |
|---|---|
| 50th | $2,888 |
| 75th | $3,473 |
| 90th | $4,125 |
| **95th** | **$4,550** |
| 99th | $5,411 |

### Position Sizing Recommendations

Based on Monte Carlo 95th percentile DD of $4,550:

| Account | 0.5% risk | 1.0% risk | 1.5% risk | 2.0% risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| $50,000 | 1.7ct, DD $7,695 (15%) | 3.4ct, DD $15,390 (31%) | 5.1ct, DD $23,085 (46%) | 6.8ct, DD $30,780 (62%) |
| $100,000 | 3.4ct, DD $15,390 (15%) | 6.8ct, DD $30,780 (31%) | 10.1ct, DD $46,170 (46%) | 13.5ct, DD $61,559 (62%) |
| $150,000 | 5.1ct, DD $23,085 (15%) | 10.1ct, DD $46,170 (31%) | 15.2ct, DD $69,254 (46%) | 20.3ct, DD $92,339 (62%) |

### Compounding vs Fixed Sizing
Starting with $150K, 283 trades:
| Mode | Final P&L | Max DD |
|---|---|---|
| **Fixed (1 MNQ)** | **$19,462** | **$3,334** |
| Compound (1% risk) | $7,520 | $89,732 |

**Compounding HURTS (0.4x)** -- sizing variation amplifies drawdown sequences. The system doesn't have high enough expectancy to compound aggressively.

### Prop Firm Analysis (Tradeify $150K Select Flex)
Rules: $9K profit target, $4.5K trailing DD (EOD)

| Sizing | Expected P&L | Expected Max DD | DD/Limit | Safe? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1 MNQ** | **$19,462** | **$3,334** | **74%** | **YES -- passes** |
| 2 MNQ | $38,923 | $6,667 | 148% | NO -- exceeds limit |

- At 1 MNQ: Hits $9K profit target after ~218 trades (around Dec 5, 2025)
- At 2 MNQ: Would blow the $4,500 DD limit
- **Recommendation:** Start at 1 MNQ. Only scale to 2 after building $3K+ equity buffer above the trailing DD watermark.

## Summary: Improvement Priorities

| Priority | Action | Expected Impact |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Drop Bear Accept** (-$2,553 drag) | +$2,553 immediately |
| 2 | **Fix OR Rev LONG side** (48% WR vs 72% SHORT) | Potential +$1,000-$2,000 |
| 3 | **Fix Trend Bull VWAP alignment** (misses real trend days) | Recover 9+ sessions/year |
| 4 | **Evaluate dropping P-Day** (-$514, 0.04 R:R) | +$514, cleaner portfolio |
| 5 | **B-Day regime filter** (only trade HIGH+MED vol) | Cut -$838 in NORMAL/LOW losses |
| 6 | **Edge Fade MED vol filter** (loses -$1,052) | Small improvement |

**Core portfolio (OR Rev + Edge Fade only):** 161 trades, ~$22,396 net, cleaner risk profile.
