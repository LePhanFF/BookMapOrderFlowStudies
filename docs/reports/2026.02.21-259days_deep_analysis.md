# Deep Analysis Report: 259-Session Full-Year Backtest
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Dataset:** 259 sessions (Feb 20 2025 - Feb 20 2026)
**Branch:** `feature/next-improvements`

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The full-year backtest reveals **massive untapped potential**. Current system produces 283 trades / $19,462 net, but:

- **Trail stop at 0.5R would produce $48,894** (2.5x current P&L) with 80% WR
- **VWAP alignment is the #1 trade killer** — 9 of 16 trend_up sessions missed because VWAP diverges from price during strong trends
- **34% of losing trades saw 1R+ profit** before reversing — breakeven management could convert many
- **B-Day strategy has 5.3R avg MFE** but -0.2R actual — worst trade management of any strategy
- Only **3 sessions out of 259 are truly dead** (no strategy opportunity)

## 2. Why Strategies Don't Fire (Zero-Trade Session Analysis)

### 2.1 Dynamic Day Type Classification — NOT the problem

Every session eventually classifies as b_day (100%) and p_day (95%). Day type gates are NOT blocking trades. The problem is deeper:

| Day Type | Sessions Classified | % |
|---|---|---|
| b_day | 259 | 100% |
| p_day | 245 | 95% |
| neutral | 77 | 30% |
| trend_down | 75 | 29% |
| trend_up | 69 | 27% |
| super_trend_down | 17 | 7% |
| super_trend_up | 6 | 2% |

### 2.2 Regime Gates — Minor impact

Removing regime gates only adds 21 trades (+$178). The gates correctly filter low-quality setups.

### 2.3 The REAL Problem: Entry Criteria Too Strict

**Trend Day Bull — VWAP Alignment kills 9 of 16 trend_up sessions:**
- On strong trend days, VWAP **lags behind price** (it's a volume-weighted average)
- The strategy requires price to be within 30% of IB range from VWAP
- During a genuine trend day with 1.5-5x extension, VWAP is 100+ pts behind
- Example: 2025-04-09 (IB=403, ext=4.86x) — 0 VWAP-aligned bars despite massive trend

**Trend Bull and P-Day — Entry criteria designed for moderate moves:**
- These strategies expect a pullback to VWAP, which doesn't happen on strong trend days
- The stronger the trend, the less likely a VWAP pullback occurs
- They paradoxically miss the best trend days

**Bear Accept — High WR but negative expectancy:**
- 67% WR but targets are only 0.75x IB range
- Stops are 0.25x IB above IBL
- R:R is inverted: risking more than targeting

### 2.4 Session Coverage

Only **3 sessions are truly dead** (no extension, no edge touch). 256/259 sessions have trade opportunities but entry criteria prevent execution.

## 3. MFE Analysis — How Much Are We Leaving on the Table?

### 3.1 Overall

| Metric | Winners (157) | Losers (126) |
|---|---|---|
| Avg MFE | 1.6R (187 pts) | 1.1R (82 pts) |
| Avg Actual | 1.9R | -1.0R |
| Losers that saw 1R+ profit | — | 43 (34%) |
| Losers that saw 0.5R+ profit | — | 63 (50%) |

**Key insight: 50% of losers were once profitable.** Better trade management would convert many to winners or breakeven.

### 3.2 By Strategy — Where the Opportunity Is

| Strategy | Trades | Avg MFE | Avg Actual | Left/trade | Losers>1R% |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **B-Day** | 19 | **5.3R** | -0.2R | 26pts | **91%** |
| Edge Fade | 96 | 1.4R | -0.1R | 9pts | 38% |
| OR Reversal | 65 | 1.3R | 0.7R | 28pts | 44% |
| Bear Accept | 58 | 1.1R | -0.2R | 116pts | 26% |
| Trend Bull | 21 | 0.2R | -0.4R | 80pts | 0% |
| P-Day | 23 | 0.2R | -0.5R | 69pts | 7% |

**B-Day is the most mismanaged strategy**: 5.3R average MFE with -0.2R actual result. 91% of B-Day losers saw 1R+ profit. The strategy catches moves but gives them all back.

## 4. Trade Management — What-If Analysis

### 4.1 Trail Stop Simulation

| Trail Distance | Trades | WR | Net P&L | $/trade | vs Baseline |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **0.5R trail** | 283 | **80%** | **$48,894** | $173 | **+$29,432** |
| 0.75R trail | 283 | 70% | $36,822 | $130 | +$17,360 |
| 1.0R trail | 283 | 63% | $27,605 | $98 | +$8,143 |
| 1.5R trail | 283 | 52% | $14,523 | $51 | -$4,939 |
| Baseline (fixed) | 283 | 56% | $19,462 | $69 | — |

**0.5R trail stop is the clear winner**: Once price moves 0.5R in our favor, trail the stop. This captures $48,894 vs $19,462 baseline — a 151% improvement.

### 4.2 Breakeven After Displacement

| BE Trigger | Wins | BE Exits | Net P&L | $/trade |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.3R | 124 | 97 | $33,360 | $118 |
| 0.5R | 130 | 78 | $30,175 | $107 |
| 0.75R | 142 | 54 | $27,552 | $97 |
| 1.0R | 149 | 39 | $25,699 | $91 |

**BE at 0.3R** is optimal: move to breakeven after price moves just 0.3R in your favor. 97 trades that would have been losers become scratch trades.

### 4.3 IB-Scaled Targets

| Target | Hits | WR | Net P&L | $/trade |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.5x IB | 156 | 55% | $14,130 | $50 |
| 0.75x IB | 96 | 34% | $23,109 | $82 |
| **1.0x IB** | 63 | 22% | **$27,947** | $99 |
| 1.5x IB | 24 | 8% | $29,077 | $103 |
| 2.0x IB | 8 | 3% | $23,372 | $83 |

**1.0-1.5x IB range targets maximize P&L**. Current 2R fixed targets may be too aggressive for some strategies, too conservative for others.

## 5. Volatility Regime Analysis

| Regime | Trades | WR | Net P&L | Avg Risk | Avg MFE |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Low (<100 IB) | 28 | 43% | -$2,077 | 46pts | 1.1R |
| Med (100-150) | 46 | 67% | $3,716 | 53pts | 1.4R |
| Normal (150-250) | 113 | 53% | $5,676 | 73pts | 1.5R |
| **High (>250)** | 96 | 56% | **$12,147** | 93pts | 1.4R |

**High-vol sessions (>250 IB) produce 62% of total P&L** with only 34% of trades. Low-vol sessions are net negative.

## 6. Exit Reason Analysis

| Exit Reason | Trades | WR | Net P&L | Avg MFE |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TARGET | 105 | 100% | $42,577 | 2.1R |
| STOP | 100 | 0% | -$29,512 | **1.3R** |
| VWAP_BREACH_PM | 31 | 39% | -$818 | 1.1R |
| EOD | 47 | 85% | $7,214 | 0.2R |

**Stopped-out trades had 1.3R avg MFE** — they were profitable at some point. Better trailing would have captured that.

**EOD exits have 85% WR** but only 0.2R MFE — these are slow grinders that never reach target. They work fine, just small.

## 7. Actionable Recommendations

### Priority 1: Implement Trail Stop (HIGHEST IMPACT)
- **Trail at 0.5R**: Once MFE reaches 0.5x risk, trail stop to entry
- Then trail from peak at 0.5R behind
- Expected improvement: **$19,462 → $48,894 (+151%)**
- This is the single biggest improvement available

### Priority 2: Fix Trend Bull VWAP Alignment
- Current: requires price within 30% IB of VWAP
- Problem: VWAP lags on trend days (by design — it's a mean)
- Fix options:
  a. **Use VWAP slope instead of proximity** — rising VWAP confirms trend
  b. **Accept entry if price ever touched VWAP post-IB** (pullback already happened)
  c. **Replace VWAP check with acceptance + momentum** (OTF + delta)
- Expected: recover 9+ missed trend day trades

### Priority 3: Fix B-Day Trade Management
- Current: fixed stop/target with 5.3R avg MFE but -0.2R actual
- 91% of B-Day losers saw 1R+ profit
- Fix: **Use trail stop specifically for B-Day** — these are breakout trades that move far
- Consider: partial at 1R, trail remainder

### Priority 4: ATR/VIX-Scaled Position Sizing
- High-vol (>250 IB): wider stops, smaller size, larger targets
- Low-vol (<100 IB): either skip (current) or tighter stops, bigger size
- Current fixed approach misses the regime adaptation

### Priority 5: Bear Accept R:R Inversion
- 67% WR but negative expectancy — stops wider than targets
- Fix: either widen targets (1.0x IB instead of 0.75x) or tighten stops (0.15x instead of 0.25x)
- Or: use trail stop — Bear Accept has 1.1R avg MFE, plenty of room

---

## 8. Implementation Priority Order

1. **Trail stop system** (biggest P&L impact, affects all strategies)
2. **Trend Bull VWAP fix** (recover 9+ missed trades per year)
3. **B-Day trail management** (convert 91% of losers)
4. **Bear Accept R:R fix** (flip $-2,553 to positive)
5. **VIX-scaled sizing** (longer-term improvement)
