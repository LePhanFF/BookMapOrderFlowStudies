## Research Conclusions: What Works and What Doesn't

### What WORKS

1. **Opening Range Reversal (Judas Swing)** -- The single best edge in the system.
   SHORT side is dominant (75% WR, $336/trade). Fade the false move at the open
   when it sweeps overnight/prior-day levels, then reverses through OR midpoint.

2. **Edge Fade (IB Edge Mean Reversion)** -- Reliable volume strategy on balance days.
   LONG ONLY. When price visits the lower 25% of IB with buyer confirmation, fade
   back to IB midpoint. Works on b_day and neutral sessions with expanded IB.

3. **IB Regime Filter** -- The single biggest improvement (+$5,657, +29%). Skip LOW IB
   sessions entirely. Each strategy has its own optimal IB regime whitelist.

### What DOESN'T WORK

4. **Trend following (Trend Bull, Trend Bear)** -- NQ trends fail more than they
   follow through. Wide IB days that look like trend days often revert to balance.
   The failed trend IS the trade (Edge Fade captures this).

5. **IB Retest (VWAP pullback after IB break)** -- Tested today. BULL side is a
   structural failure (-$2,362, 44.3% WR). BEAR side is breakeven noise (+$142,
   35.4% WR). The post-OR pullback to VWAP simply does not produce a tradeable edge.

6. **Trail stops and breakeven moves** -- Tested extensively (13 management configs
   x 7 strategies). Trail/BE REGRESSES performance ($13,986 vs $19,462 baseline).
   Fixed targets work better because MR trades oscillate; trailing gets stopped
   out on noise before hitting the target.

7. **Skip-after-bad-day** -- Recovery days are profitable. Skipping hurts.

8. **Capping high IB** -- Cutting IB<350 loses $11,092. Don't cap the upside.

### The Daily Playbook (What to Actually Trade)

| Time | Action | Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| **9:30-10:00** | Wait for Judas Swing to sweep a level | OR Reversal |
| **9:45-10:00** | If sweep + reversal through OR mid, ENTER | OR Reversal |
| **10:00-10:30** | IB forming, no new entries | -- |
| **10:30-13:30** | If b_day/neutral + price at IB lower edge, ENTER LONG | Edge Fade |
| **13:30-16:00** | No new entries (PM morph kills MR) | -- |

**That's it.** Two strategies, two time windows, clear rules.

## Entry, Stop, and Target Details

All backtest numbers below are based on **1 MNQ contract** (~$130 avg risk per trade).

### OR Reversal: Fixed 2R Target

| Metric | SHORT (75% WR) | LONG (54% WR) |
|---|---|---|
| Avg risk | 69 pts ($138) | 70 pts ($140) |
| Target | 2R = ~138 pts ($276) | 2R = ~140 pts ($280) |
| Avg realized R (winners) | 1.19R | 0.31R |
| Avg win | $512 | $433 |
| Avg loss | $-192 | $-213 |
| Winners hitting full 2R target | 17 of 24 (71%) | 4 of 13 (31%) |

**Stop:** Sweep extreme + 15% of EOR range (above EOR high for SHORT, below EOR low for LONG).
**Target:** 2x the risk distance from entry. Example: SHORT entry 25350, stop 25450 (100pt risk) -> target 25150 (200pt reward).

SHORT side works because 71% of winners reach the full 2R target. LONG side underperforms
because most winners exit via EOD or VWAP breach PM before hitting 2R (only 31% reach target).

### Edge Fade: IB Midpoint Target (~1.6R)

| Metric | EDGE_TO_MID |
|---|---|
| Avg risk | 59 pts ($118) |
| Target | IB midpoint = ~109 pts ($218) |
| Target R ratio | ~1.6R |
| Avg realized R (winners) | 0.82R |
| Avg win | $410 |
| Avg loss | $-324 |
| Winners hitting IB mid target | 42 of 54 (78%) |

**Stop:** IBL - 15% of IB range.
**Target:** IB midpoint (halfway between IBH and IBL).
78% of winners hit the full IB mid target at avg $495/trade.

### Exit Reason Breakdown (All Strategies)

| Exit | Count | % | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| TARGET | 83 | 38.2% | Hit the fixed profit target |
| STOP | 59 | 27.2% | Hit the stop loss |
| VWAP_BREACH_PM | 38 | 17.5% | Price crossed VWAP after 13:00 (afternoon reversal protection) |
| EOD | 37 | 17.1% | Flat by close at 15:59 |

## 5-Account Prop Firm Scenarios

### Important: Backtest Baseline is 1 MNQ Contract

The $23,516 net P&L (OR Rev + Edge Fade) is from **1 MNQ contract per trade** with
~$130 average risk. Scaling to more contracts multiplies P&L proportionally but also
multiplies drawdown and worst-day losses.

### Position Sizing Options

| Contracts | Risk/Trade | Annual P&L/Acct | Worst Day | Max DD | DD vs $4.5K Limit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1 MNQ** | ~$130 | $23,516 | -$1,468 | $2,262 | 50% (safe) |
| **2 MNQ** | ~$260 | $47,032 | -$2,935 | $4,524 | 100% (tight) |
| **3 MNQ** | ~$390 | $70,549 | -$4,403 | $6,786 | 151% (DANGER) |

**Recommendation: 2 MNQ for eval, scale to 3 MNQ on funded account.**
At 3 MNQ, worst day (-$4,403) nearly hits the $4,500 trailing DD limit. Too risky for eval.
At 2 MNQ, worst day (-$2,935) is 65% of the limit -- safe margin.

### Live Performance Discount

Backtests overestimate live performance. Expect 50-70% of backtest results due to:
- Execution delays and missed fills (especially at the open for OR Rev)
- Slippage scales worse with more contracts on MNQ
- Emotional interference / discipline breaks
- Dec 2025 was 27% of annual P&L ($6,729) -- goldilocks vol, can't guarantee it repeats

| Scenario | 1 MNQ/Acct | 2 MNQ/Acct | 5 Accounts (2 MNQ) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Backtest (100%) | $23,516 | $47,032 | $235,161 |
| **70% live factor** | **$16,461** | **$32,923** | **$164,613** |
| 50% live factor | $11,758 | $23,516 | $117,579 |

Even at 50% of backtest, each account clears the $9K Tradeify target.

### Scenario A: COPY TRADE (all 5 accounts take every trade)
| Metric | Per Account (2 MNQ) | All 5 |
|---|---|---|
| Trades | 149 | 745 |
| Net P&L (backtest) | $47,032 | $235,161 |
| Net P&L (70% live) | $32,923 | $164,613 |
| Max DD | $4,524 | $4,524 (simultaneous) |
| Worst Day | -$2,935 | -$2,935 (all at once) |

**Pros:** Maximum P&L. Every account hits $9K target easily. Simple execution.
**Cons:** ALL accounts draw down at the same time. One bad streak hits all 5.

### Scenario B: ROUND-ROBIN (rotate trades across accounts)
| Account | Trades | Net P&L (1 MNQ) | Max DD |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 30 | $3,472 | $1,166 |
| 2 | 30 | $1,790 | $987 |
| 3 | 30 | $5,137 | $541 |
| 4 | 30 | $5,564 | $860 |
| 5 | 29 | $7,552 | $884 |
| **Combined** | **149** | **$23,516** | -- |

**Pros:** Drawdowns decorrelated. No single account takes heavy consecutive losses.
**Cons:** Some accounts slower to hit $9K target. Account 2 only makes $1,790 at 1 MNQ
(needs more time or more contracts).

### Scenario C: STRATEGY SPLIT (OR Rev x3, Edge Fade x2)
| Strategy | Accts | P&L/Acct (1 MNQ) | DD/Acct | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OR Rev | 3 | $14,030 | $873 | $42,089 |
| Edge Fade | 2 | $9,486 | $2,374 | $18,972 |
| **Combined** | **5** | -- | -- | **$61,061** |

**Pros:** OR Rev accounts have tiny drawdown ($873). Strategy-level risk isolation.
**Cons:** Edge Fade accounts have larger DD. Uneven distribution.

### Recommendation: COPY TRADE at 2 MNQ

Copy trade is the best approach because:
1. **Every account passes** the $9K target even at 50% live factor ($23,516 at 2 MNQ)
2. **Max DD at 2 MNQ is ~$4,524** = tight but survivable vs $4.5K Tradeify limit
3. Simpler execution -- one signal, five platforms
4. The "correlated drawdown" risk is manageable because the system has zero losing months

**For eval phase:** Use 2 MNQ (~$260 risk/trade). Worst day $2,935 = 65% of limit.
**After funded:** Scale to 3 MNQ (~$390 risk/trade). More room with funded account buffer.

## Trade Management: Fixed Targets Are Optimal

This was tested in the `diag_trade_management_study.py` across 13 configurations:

| Config | Net P&L | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Current (fixed targets)** | **$25,119** | Baseline, optimal |
| Trail 1R + BE at 0.5R | $13,986 | -45% vs baseline |
| Trail 0.5R + BE at 0.3R | $14,200 | -44% vs baseline |
| Fixed 1.5R target | $22,800 | Close but worse |
| Fixed 3R target | $18,400 | Overreaching |

**Why trails hurt:** Mean reversion trades oscillate. A trail at 1R locks in small
gains but gets stopped out before hitting the full target. The fixed 2R target on
OR Rev and the IB mid target on Edge Fade are already calibrated to the natural
price action of these setups.
