# OR Reversal NT8 Sync -- Performance Report
**Date:** 2026-02-24 | **Dataset:** 260 sessions (Feb 2025 -- Feb 2026) | **Instrument:** MNQ

## Summary

Ported 5 improvements from NT8 ORReversalSignal.cs to Python backtest.
**Result: +$1,245 (+8.9%) improvement** with better PF, WR, and Sharpe.

## Changes Applied (5 of 6 planned)

| # | Change | Impact | Verdict |
|---|--------|--------|---------|
| 1 | London H/L as sweep candidates | +15 trades (unfiltered), neutral net | APPLIED |
| 2 | Proximity-based sweep (closest) | No change on 1-min bars | APPLIED |
| 3 | Dual-sweep depth comparison | -9 trades, +1.8% WR, -$1K net | APPLIED |
| 4 | EOR mid entry zone | **-13 trades, -5.7% WR, -$7.3K** | **REVERTED** |
| 5 | Stop at swept reference level | Same trades, -1.5% WR, -$1.9K | APPLIED |
| 6 | CVD divergence as delta alt | +2 trades, +1.2% WR, +$1K | APPLIED (best single change) |

### Change 4 Deep Dive (REVERTED)
EOR mid works well on NT8's 5-min charts (OR = only 3 bars, distorted midpoint).
On 1-min bars, OR already has 15 bars (accurate midpoint). Switching to EOR mid
raises the SHORT entry threshold, killing 13 good SHORT trades for -$7.3K.

**Decision:** Keep EOR mid in NT8 (5-min), use OR mid in Python backtest (1-min).

## Before vs After -- OR Reversal (with regime filter)

| Metric | Baseline | NT8 Synced | Change |
|--------|----------|------------|--------|
| Trades | 56 | 56 | -- |
| Win Rate | 66.1% | **67.9%** | +1.8% |
| Net P&L | $14,030 | **$15,275** | +$1,245 |
| PF | 4.61 | **5.18** | +0.57 |
| Max DD | $873 | $922 | +$49 |

## Portfolio Impact (OR Rev + Edge Fade)

| Metric | Old Portfolio | New Portfolio | Change |
|--------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| Trades | 149 | 149 | -- |
| Net P&L | $23,516 | **$24,761** | +$1,245 |
| OR Rev | $14,030 | $15,275 | +$1,245 |
| Edge Fade | $9,486 | $9,486 | Unchanged |
| Max DD | $2,262 | $2,323 | +$61 |

**Edge Fade completely unaffected** -- changes only touch or_reversal.py.

## ATR Stop Study

Tested ATR-based stops as alternative to swept level + 15% buffer.
All variants use the same entry logic (with all 5 NT8 improvements).

| Stop Method | Trades | WR | Net | PF | DD | AvgW | AvgL |
|-------------|--------|-----|------|------|------|-------|-------|
| **Current (swept+15%)** | 67 | 62.7% | $16,028 | **3.84** | **$1,300** | $516 | $226 |
| 1.0 ATR | 67 | 62.7% | $20,324 | 2.99 | $1,664 | $728 | $409 |
| **1.5 ATR** | 67 | **64.2%** | **$21,014** | 3.25 | $1,722 | $706 | $389 |
| 2.0 ATR | 67 | 62.7% | $19,479 | 3.12 | $1,601 | $683 | $368 |
| **2.5 ATR** | 67 | **67.2%** | **$21,677** | **3.76** | $1,660 | $656 | $356 |
| 3.0 ATR | 67 | 64.2% | $19,825 | 3.39 | $1,528 | $654 | $345 |

### Key Findings
- ATR stops are wider, giving trades more room to breathe (+$3-5K net)
- **2.5 ATR is the sweet spot**: highest WR (67.2%), highest net ($21,677), best PF (3.76)
- 1.5 ATR is the tightest viable option with decent results
- Current stop has lowest DD ($1,300) but also lowest net ($16,028)
- All ATR variants increase avg win AND avg loss (wider stops = wider targets at 2R)

### Recommendation
**For prop firm:** Keep current stop (lowest DD, highest PF, safety-first)
**For personal account:** Consider 2.5 ATR stop for 35% more P&L with similar PF

## A/B Test Methodology

Each change tested independently on 260 sessions, no filters, then combinations tested:

| Combination | Trades | WR | Net | PF | DD |
|-------------|--------|-----|------|------|------|
| Baseline (no changes) | 65 | 61.5% | $13,962 | 3.34 | $1,363 |
| All 6 changes | 54 | 57.4% | $8,586 | 2.48 | $2,486 |
| **All except EOR mid (FINAL)** | **67** | **62.7%** | **$16,028** | **3.84** | **$1,300** |
| London+closest+CVD | 84 | 57.1% | $15,370 | 2.72 | $1,667 |
| London+swept+CVD | 84 | 54.8% | $13,672 | 2.56 | $1,919 |
