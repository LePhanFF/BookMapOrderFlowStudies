# Evaluation Risk Scaling Study

## Monte Carlo Simulation: How Fast Can We Pass?

**Date**: February 19, 2026
**Simulations**: 50,000 per risk level
**Trade data**: 110 trades from v14 backtest (62 sessions)
**Rules**: Tradeify $150K Select Flex ($9,000 target, $4,500 trailing DD)
**Assumption**: 1 allowed reset per evaluation ($219/attempt)

## Trade Distribution (from v14 backtest)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total trades | 110 |
| Win rate | 58.2% |
| Avg win | $377.91 |
| Avg loss | -$261.71 |
| Expectancy | $110.43/trade |
| Worst single loss | -$426.48 |

## Results Summary

| Multiplier | Exp/Trade | Worst Loss | Pass % (w/ reset) | Blow % (single) | Median Days | P95 Peak DD | Avg Cost |
|------------|-----------|------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **1.00x** | $110 | -$426 | 98.3% | 0.5% | 116 | $3,110 | $220 |
| **1.25x** | $138 | -$533 | 99.5% | 1.9% | 92 | $3,733 | $223 |
| **1.50x** | $166 | -$640 | 99.8% | 3.9% | 77 | $4,319 | $228 |
| **1.75x** | $193 | -$746 | 99.5% | 7.2% | 65 | $4,626 | $234 |
| **2.00x** | $221 | -$853 | 99.0% | 10.1% | 56 | $4,795 | $241 |

## Key Findings

### All multipliers are viable
Every risk level has a 98%+ pass rate when accounting for 1 reset. Even at 2.0x, the chance of blowing BOTH attempts is only 0.9%.

### Speed improvement is significant
- 1.0x: **116 days** median (nearly 6 months)
- 1.5x: **77 days** median (about 4 months) - 34% faster
- 2.0x: **56 days** median (about 3 months) - 52% faster

### The blowup risk is manageable
| Multiplier | Single attempt blowup | Both attempts blowup | Risk assessment |
|------------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 1.0x | 0.5% | ~0% | Nearly zero risk |
| 1.25x | 1.9% | 0.1% | Very safe |
| 1.50x | 3.9% | 0.2% | Safe |
| 1.75x | 7.2% | 0.4% | Acceptable |
| 2.0x | 10.1% | 0.9% | Aggressive but viable |

### Drawdown headroom narrows at higher multipliers
- At 1.0x: P95 peak DD = $3,110 (31% buffer to $4,500 limit)
- At 1.5x: P95 peak DD = $4,319 (4% buffer - tight)
- At 2.0x: P95 peak DD = $4,795 (over the limit in worst 5% of cases)

## Detailed Breakdown

### 1.50x (Balanced Choice)
- Pass rate: **99.8%** with 1 reset
- Median: **77 days** to pass
- Single attempt blowup: 3.9%
- Both attempts blowup: 0.2%
- P95 drawdown: $4,319 (4% buffer)
- Cost: ~$228

### 2.00x (Aggressive Choice)
- Pass rate: **99.0%** with 1 reset
- Median: **56 days** to pass
- Single attempt blowup: 10.1%
- Both attempts blowup: 0.9%
- P95 drawdown: $4,795 (over limit in tail)
- Cost: ~$241

---

## Recommendation

**1.50x risk** is the sweet spot:
- Nearly identical pass rate to 1.0x (99.8% vs 98.3%)
- 34% faster (77 vs 116 days)
- Only 0.2% chance of blowing both attempts
- P95 drawdown stays under the $4,500 limit (barely)

**2.0x risk** is viable if speed is the priority:
- Still 99% pass rate with a reset
- 52% faster than baseline
- 10% single-attempt blowup rate means you'll likely need the reset ~1 in 10 times
- Extra cost: ~$21 over baseline

**The reset makes everything safe.** The real risk is not the blowup itself (that costs $219), it's the time lost. At 2.0x, a blown first attempt adds ~56 more days. At 1.5x, a blown attempt is rarer (4% vs 10%) and the time penalty is smaller.

## Next Steps

- Re-run this simulation after backtesting on 200+ sessions of expanded CSV data
- The larger sample may change the trade distribution and blowup probabilities
- Consider a hybrid approach: start at 1.5x, increase to 2.0x once $3,000+ buffer is built
