## Strategy Roster (6 Active Strategies)

### Strategy 1: Trend Day Bull (LONG)

**When**: Day type = `trend_up` or strong `p_day` (ext_up > 1.0x IB)

**How to identify**: After 10:30, if price has extended more than 1x IB range above IBH with 2+ consecutive bars closing above IBH (acceptance), this is a trend day.

**Entry**:
1. Wait for IBH acceptance (2+ bars above IBH)
2. Wait for price to pull back to VWAP
3. Check pre-entry 10-bar delta sum > -500 (no aggressive selling)
4. Check OF quality gate: 2 of 3 positive (delta_pctl >= 60, imbalance > 1.0, vol_spike >= 1.0)
5. Enter LONG at VWAP

**Stop**: VWAP - 40% of IB range

**Target**: EOD exit (captures natural trend drift)

**Time window**: 10:30 - 13:00

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Trades | 8 |
| Win Rate | 75% |
| Avg Win | $180 |
| Avg Loss | -$2.74 (breakeven) |
| Expectancy | **$134/trade** |
| Max DD | -$3 |
| PF | 197 |

---

### Strategy 2: P-Day (LONG)

**When**: Day type = `p_day` (ext_up 0.5-1.0x IB, bullish skew)

**How to identify**: Price extends above IBH by 0.5-1.0x IB range. The session has directional bias but not a full trend day.

**Entry**: Identical to Trend Day Bull (VWAP pullback after acceptance)

**Stop**: VWAP - 40% of IB range

**Target**: EOD exit

**Time window**: 10:30 - 13:00

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Trades | 8 |
| Win Rate | 75% |
| Avg Win | $180 |
| Avg Loss | -$2.74 (breakeven) |
| Expectancy | **$134/trade** |
| Max DD | -$3 |
| PF | 197 |

---

### Strategy 3: B-Day IBL Fade (LONG)

**When**: Day type = `b_day` (ext 0.2-0.5x, balanced), b_day_confidence >= 0.5

**How to identify**: Price stays within or slightly outside IB range. IBL and IBH are acting as support/resistance. This is the highest expectancy strategy.

**Entry**:
1. Price touches IBL (lower IB edge)
2. Delta > 0 on touch bar (buyers stepping in)
3. Quality score >= 2 (volume, wick rejection, FVG confluence)
4. IB range < 400 pts

**Stop**: IBL - 10% of IB range

**Target**: IB midpoint (mean reversion to center)

**Time window**: Before 14:00

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Trades | 4 |
| Win Rate | 100% |
| Avg Win | $571 |
| Expectancy | **$571/trade** |
| Max DD | $0 |
| PF | INF |

---

### Strategy 4: Edge Fade - OPTIMIZED (LONG)

**When**: Day type = `b_day` or `neutral`, on NON-BEARISH days (ext_down < 0.3x)

**How to identify**: Price is in the lower 25% of IB range (near IBL). The day is balanced/neutral with IB < 200 pts. No strong bearish extension.

**CRITICAL FILTERS (from deep dive analysis)**:
- IB range < 200 pts (wider IB = 0% WR, stop too large)
- NOT a bearish day (ext_down < 0.3x IB, otherwise 37% WR vs 82% WR)
- Entry before 13:30 (PM after 13:30 = 33% WR, 0% WR at 13:30-14:00)

**Entry**:
1. Price in lower 25% of IB range
2. Delta > 0 (buyer present)
3. OF quality >= 2 of 3
4. 20-bar cooldown between entries

**Stop**: IBL - 15% of IB range

**Target**: IB midpoint

**Time window**: 10:30 - 13:30

**Optional confluence (higher conviction)**:
- Near LVN (low volume node): 62% WR vs 48% near HVN
- After IBL sweep + reclaim: price swept below IBL then recovered
- IBH has been tested (double top structure)

| Metric | CURRENT (90 trades) | OPTIMIZED (17 trades) |
|---|---|---|
| Trades | 90 | **17** |
| Win Rate | 53% | **94%** |
| Avg Win | $411 | $503 |
| Avg Loss | -$286 | -$351 |
| Expectancy | $86 | **$453** |
| Net P&L | $7,714 | **$7,696** |
| Max DD | -$3,500 | **-$351** |
| Max Consec Loss | 10 | **1** |
| PF | 1.64 | **22.94** |

The 73 removed trades generate only $19 net but cause $11,677 in gross losses. They are pure noise.

**Why the old version failed**:
- 10 trades on trend_down days (10% WR, -$3,149): fading a breakdown
- 24 PM trades after 13:30 (33% WR, -$1,863): PM morph kills mean reversion
- 16 trades on IB > 250 (25% WR, -$2,897): stop distance too wide
- 20 trades stopped out in < 10 bars (15% WR, -$5,424): wrong entry entirely

---

### Strategy 5: IBH Sweep + Failure Fade (SHORT)

**When**: Day type = `b_day`, price sweeps above IBH into liquidity then fails

**How to identify**: On balance days, price briefly pokes above IBH (sweeping stops/liquidity at PDH, London High, etc.) but fails to hold. Multiple tests at IBH that fail = exhaustion.

**Entry**:
1. Price sweeps above IBH (touches PDH, London High, or other liquidity)
2. Price fails to close above IBH (rejection)
3. Delta < 0 on failure bar (sellers stepping in)
4. Quality >= 2

**Stop**: Above sweep high + 15% IB range

**Target**: IB midpoint

**Time window**: AM to early PM

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Trades | 4 |
| Win Rate | 100% |
| Expectancy | **$146/trade** |
| Max DD | $0 |
| Note | Small sample, use conservatively |

**CAUTION**: Only 4 trades. b_day only. On p_day this is 23% WR.

---

### Strategy 6: Bear Acceptance Short (SHORT)

**When**: Day type = `trend_down` or `b_day_bear` (ext_down > 0.5x IB)

**How to identify**: Price has accepted below IBL with 3+ consecutive bars closing below. This is a structural breakdown, not a temporary dip.

**Entry**:
1. 3+ consecutive bars close below IBL (acceptance confirmed)
2. Day type is `trend_down` or `b_day_bear`
3. Short at close of the 3rd acceptance bar

**Stop**: IBL + 25% of IB range (if price reclaims IBL, thesis invalid)

**Target**: IBL - 0.75x IB range (0.75x downward extension)

**Time window**: Before 14:00

**HTF confluence (optional, higher conviction)**:
- Price inside 4H bearish FVG zone
- Price inside daily bearish FVG
- PDH swept and failed (ERL to IRL)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Trades | 11 |
| Win Rate | 64% |
| Avg Win | $203 |
| Avg Loss | -$107 |
| W:L Ratio | 1.9:1 |
| Expectancy | **$90/trade** |
| Max DD | -$289 |
| DD Recovery | 3.2 trades |
| Max Consec Loss | 3 |
| PF | 3.32 |

**DAY TYPE IS EVERYTHING for shorts**:
- `trend_down`: 64% WR, +649 pts
- `b_day_bear`: 55% WR, +275 pts
- `b_day`: 14% WR, -839 pts (DO NOT SHORT)
- `neutral`: 10% WR, -768 pts (DO NOT SHORT)

## Prop Firm Eval Strategy

### Tradeify $150K Select Flex

- **Profit Target**: $9,000
- **Trailing Drawdown**: $4,500 (EOD)
- **No daily loss limit**

**Strategy**: Trade the optimized portfolio as-is.
- Expectancy: $264/trade
- At ~1.9 trades/day on active days, ~35 trades needed to hit $9,000
- Max DD of -$351 is only 7.8% of your $4,500 DD allowance
- Even 3 consecutive losses (max observed) = -$351 worst case

**Eval Timeline**: ~3-4 weeks with consistent trading

### Lightning/Funded Account Strategy

**Phase 1 (First $3,000)**: Trade all 6 strategies at 1 MNQ
- Ultra-conservative, build buffer before scaling
- B-Day IBL Fade is your A+ setup ($571 expectancy) - size up when it appears

**Phase 2 ($3,000-$6,000 buffer)**: Scale to 2 MNQ on A setups
- A setups: B-Day IBL Fade, Trend Bull/P-Day (proven 75-100% WR)
- B setups: Edge Fade, Bear Accept Short (keep at 1 MNQ)

**Phase 3 ($6,000+ buffer)**: Scale to 3 MNQ on all setups

**$400 daily loss limit on Edge Fade**: If 2 Edge Fade stops hit in a session, stop trading Edge Fade for the day (from target optimization study, +19% net improvement).

## Key Rules (Do NOT Violate)

1. **NEVER short on b_day or neutral** (0-14% WR)
2. **NEVER enter Edge Fade after 13:30** (33% WR, PM morph kills it)
3. **NEVER enter Edge Fade when IB > 200 pts** (0-36% WR on wide IB)
4. **NEVER enter Edge Fade on bearish days** (ext_down > 0.3x = 37% WR)
5. **NEVER use FVG as standalone entry on 1-min bars** (16% WR, counter-indicator)
6. **NEVER use trailing stops on VWAP pullback entries** (reduces P&L 50-80%)
7. **NEVER use CVDFilter** (kills B-Day trades which naturally have CVD < MA)
8. **Day type is THE filter for all entries** - classify the day first, then pick the strategy
9. **EOD exit captures the most P&L** for trend/p-day strategies
10. **Pre-entry delta < -500 = skip** (aggressive selling before entry, losers average -819 to -938)

## Edge Fade Filter Impact (90 -> 17 trades)

The deep dive showed 73 of 90 Edge Fade trades generate only $19 combined but cause $11,677 in gross losses:

| Filter | Impact |
|---|---|
| PM after 13:30 | 24 trades removed, 33% WR, -$1,863 |
| IB > 200 pts | 40 trades removed, 25-58% WR, stops too wide |
| Bearish days (ext_down > 0.3x) | 57 trades removed, 37% WR vs 82% WR on non-bearish |
| Combined (all 3 filters) | **73 removed, 17 kept: 94% WR, $453/trade, -$351 MaxDD** |

The remaining 17 trades are high-conviction AM entries on tight-IB, non-bearish balance/neutral days. Same net P&L ($7,696 vs $7,714), 10x better drawdown.
