## STRATEGY 1: Trend Day Bull (LONG)

### Concept
After the Initial Balance period (9:30-10:30), if price has broken above IBH and stayed above for 2+ bars (acceptance), wait for a pullback to VWAP. Enter long on the VWAP touch with order flow confirmation, riding the trend to EOD.

### When to Trade
- **Day type**: trend_up (extension > 1.0x IB above IBH) or strong p_day
- **Time**: 10:30-13:00 ET
- **Frequency**: ~8 trades per 62 sessions (13% of sessions)

### Entry Rules (Step-by-Step)
1. **IB acceptance**: Price must close above IBH for 2+ consecutive 1-min bars
2. **VWAP pullback**: After acceptance, price pulls back to VWAP (within 5 pts)
3. **Pre-entry delta check**: Sum of delta over last 10 bars > -500 (no aggressive selling into the pullback)
4. **OF quality gate (2 of 3 must be true)**:
   - Delta percentile >= 60 (buyers dominating)
   - Imbalance ratio > 1.0 (bid/ask imbalance favoring longs)
   - Volume spike >= 1.0x average (institutional participation)
5. **Entry**: LONG at close of the VWAP touch bar

### Exit Rules
- **Stop**: VWAP - 40% of IB range (wide enough to survive normal VWAP oscillation)
- **Target**: EOD exit at 15:59 (trend entries capture the full day's drift)
- **No trailing stop** (backtested: trailing stops reduce P&L 50-80% on these entries)

### What to Look for as a Manual Trader
- **On the chart**: IB high marked at 10:30. Watch for 2+ bars closing above IBH. Then wait for price to retrace to VWAP (blue line on most platforms).
- **Order flow**: At the VWAP touch, look at the Bookmap heatmap or footprint chart. You want to see buying delta (green) > 0, the delta percentile bar in the top 40%, and visible volume increase on the entry bar.
- **CVD indicator**: Cumulative delta should be rising or flat. If CVD is making new lows while price pulls back, the pullback may be a trend reversal, not a buying opportunity.
- **What to avoid**: If the last 10 bars show heavy negative delta (sum < -500), aggressive sellers are pushing price down, not a healthy pullback. Skip the entry.

### Performance
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Trades | 8 |
| Win Rate | 75% |
| Avg Win | $180 |
| Avg Loss | -$2.74 (breakeven stops) |
| Expectancy | **$134/trade** |
| Max Drawdown | -$3 |
| Profit Factor | 197 |

### NinjaTrader Automation
**Fully automatable**. All inputs are available in NinjaTrader:
- IB high/low calculated from first 60 bars
- VWAP is a built-in indicator
- Delta, delta percentile, imbalance ratio available via volumetric bar data
- Volume spike = current volume / 20-bar SMA(volume)
- Time gate: `Time[0] >= new TimeSpan(10, 30, 0) && Time[0] <= new TimeSpan(13, 0, 0)`
- Stop: `SetStopLoss(CalculationMode.Price, vwap - 0.40 * ibRange)`
- Target: Exit at 15:59 using `ExitLong()` in OnBarUpdate with time check

**Run as**: Part of framework strategy (shares IB calculation, day type classification with other strategies)

---

## STRATEGY 2: P-Day VWAP Pullback (LONG)

### Concept
Identical entry logic to Trend Day Bull, but triggers on P-Day classification (moderate directional extension rather than full trend). Captures sessions with 0.5-1.0x IB extension above IBH.

### When to Trade
- **Day type**: p_day (extension 0.5-1.0x IB above IBH)
- **Time**: 10:30-13:00 ET
- **Frequency**: ~8 trades per 62 sessions

### Entry Rules
Identical to Strategy 1 (Trend Day Bull). Same VWAP pullback, same OF quality gate, same pre-delta check.

### Exit Rules
Identical to Strategy 1 (VWAP - 40% IB stop, EOD exit).

### What to Look for as a Manual Trader
Same as Strategy 1. The only difference is the day type classification: P-Day has less extreme extension than a trend day. On the chart, price breaks above IBH but doesn't run as aggressively. Still, the VWAP pullback entry is the same.

### Performance
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Trades | 8 |
| Win Rate | 75% |
| Avg Win | $180 |
| Avg Loss | -$2.74 (breakeven stops) |
| Expectancy | **$134/trade** |
| Max Drawdown | -$3 |
| Profit Factor | 197 |

### NinjaTrader Automation
**Fully automatable**. Identical code to Trend Day Bull, differentiated only by day type classification at entry time. Run as part of the framework strategy.

## STRATEGY 3: B-Day IBL Fade (LONG)

### Concept
On balance days (price oscillating within IB range), when price touches the lower IB edge (IBL), enter long to fade back to IB midpoint. Balance days are mean-reverting by definition, so edge touches are high-probability fade opportunities.

### When to Trade
- **Day type**: b_day (extension 0.2-0.5x either side of IB)
- **b_day_confidence >= 0.5** (composite score from day type classification)
- **IB range < 400 pts** (wider IB is not a true balance day)
- **Time**: Before 14:00 ET
- **Frequency**: ~4 trades per 62 sessions (6% of sessions, but highest expectancy)

### Entry Rules (Step-by-Step)
1. **Day type = b_day** with confidence >= 0.5
2. **IB range < 400 pts** (extremely wide IB signals directional day, not balance)
3. **Price touches IBL**: Bar low <= IBL
4. **Delta > 0** on the touch bar (buyers stepping in at the edge)
5. **Quality score >= 2** (based on: volume at touch, wick rejection size, FVG confluence)
6. **Entry**: LONG at close of the IBL touch bar

### Exit Rules
- **Stop**: IBL - 10% of IB range (tight stop, balance day means IBL should hold)
- **Target**: IB midpoint (mean reversion target, halfway between IBH and IBL)
- **Time**: No entries after 14:00 (insufficient time to reach target)

### What to Look for as a Manual Trader
- **On the chart**: Mark IB high/low at 10:30. On balance days, price should be oscillating between IBH and IBL without trending. When price touches IBL, look for rejection (long lower wick, not a close at the lows).
- **Order flow / Bookmap**: At the IBL touch, look for buy absorption (large resting bids at IBL level that absorb selling). Delta should flip positive as buyers step in. A volume cluster at IBL confirms institutional interest.
- **CVD indicator**: CVD on balance days is often declining (it's a balance day, not a trend). DO NOT use CVD > CVD_MA as a filter here because it will reject valid B-Day trades. Instead, look for CVD to flatten or start rising as price touches IBL.
- **FVG confluence (optional)**: If there's a bullish FVG zone (gap up in recent 5-min bars) near IBL, this adds conviction.

### Performance
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Trades | 4 |
| Win Rate | 100% |
| Avg Win | $571 |
| Expectancy | **$571/trade** |
| Max Drawdown | $0 |
| Profit Factor | INF |
| Note | Small sample, highest expectancy strategy |

### NinjaTrader Automation
**Fully automatable**. All inputs available:
- IB high/low from first 60 bars
- Day type classification from IB extension ratio
- Delta from volumetric bar data
- Quality score from volume, wick size, FVG detection
- `SetProfitTarget(CalculationMode.Price, ibMid)`
- `SetStopLoss(CalculationMode.Price, ibLow - 0.10 * ibRange)`

**Run as**: Part of framework strategy.

## STRATEGY 4: Edge Fade OPTIMIZED (LONG)

### Concept
Mean reversion from the lower 25% of the IB range back to IB midpoint. Similar to B-Day IBL Fade but fires earlier (before price actually touches IBL) and on both b_day and neutral day types. This is the highest-volume strategy with 17 trades.

### When to Trade
- **Day type**: b_day or neutral
- **NOT a bearish day**: ext_down < 0.3x IB (if bearish, win rate drops to 37%)
- **IB range < 200 pts** (wider IB = 0-36% WR, stop too large)
- **Time**: 10:30-13:30 ET (after 13:30, PM morph kills mean reversion: 0% WR at 13:30-14:00)
- **Frequency**: ~17 trades per 62 sessions

### CRITICAL FILTERS (These Transform the Strategy)
Without these 3 filters, Edge Fade has 90 trades at 53% WR with -$3,500 MaxDD. With all 3 filters, it has 17 trades at 94% WR with -$351 MaxDD. Same net P&L.

| Filter | Without | With | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| NOT bearish (ext_down < 0.3x) | 37% WR | 82% WR | Removes trend_down fades |
| Before 13:30 | 33% WR PM | 61% WR AM | Cuts PM morph losses |
| IB < 200 pts | 0-36% WR | 60%+ WR | Controls stop distance |
| **All 3 combined** | **53% WR, -$3,500 DD** | **94% WR, -$351 DD** | **10x DD improvement** |

### Entry Rules (Step-by-Step)
1. **Day type = b_day or neutral**
2. **Ext_down < 0.3x IB** (not a bearish day)
3. **IB range < 200 pts**
4. **Time before 13:30**
5. **Price in lower 25% of IB range**: close > IBL AND close < IBL + 0.25 * IB range
6. **Delta > 0** (buyer present)
7. **OF quality gate (2 of 3)**: delta_pctl >= 60, imbalance > 1.0, vol_spike >= 1.0
8. **20-bar cooldown** between entries (prevents over-trading in chop)
9. **R:R >= 1.0** (reward to IB mid must be >= risk to stop)
10. **Entry**: LONG at close of qualifying bar

### Exit Rules
- **Stop**: IBL - 15% of IB range
- **Target**: IB midpoint
- **Daily loss limit**: -$400 (stop trading Edge Fade after 2 stops in a session)

### What to Look for as a Manual Trader
- **On the chart**: Mark IBL and IB midpoint. Wait for price to drift into the lower 25% of IB. The day should look balanced or choppy, not trending down.
- **Key check**: Is IB less than 200 points? Is it before 13:30? Has the session had any bearish extension below IBL exceeding 0.3x IB range? If any of these are NO, do not trade.
- **Order flow**: Look for positive delta on the entry bar. In the Bookmap heatmap, you want to see buy-side absorption or passive buyers holding the bid near the lower edge.
- **CVD indicator**: CVD may be declining (this is a balance day). What matters is delta on the specific entry bar, not the cumulative trend.
- **Time-of-day sweet spot**: 11:30-12:30 is the best window (100% WR on 13 trades). 10:30-11:00 has 53% WR (IB still forming). Avoid 13:30+ entirely.

### Optional Confluence (Higher Conviction)
- Near LVN (low volume node from prior day): 62% WR vs 48% near HVN
- After IBL sweep + reclaim: price briefly swept below IBL, then recovered
- IBH has been tested (double top structure suggests range day is confirmed)

### Performance
| Metric | Unfiltered (90 trades) | OPTIMIZED (17 trades) |
|---|---|---|
| Trades | 90 | **17** |
| Win Rate | 53% | **94%** |
| Expectancy | $86 | **$453** |
| Net P&L | $7,714 | **$7,696** |
| Max DD | -$3,500 | **-$351** |
| Max Consec Loss | 10 | **1** |
| Profit Factor | 1.64 | **22.94** |

### NinjaTrader Automation
**Fully automatable**. All calculations are straightforward:
- IB range, IBL, IB midpoint from first 60 bars
- Extension tracking: running high/low vs IB bounds
- Edge zone check: `Close[0] > ibLow && Close[0] < ibLow + 0.25 * ibRange`
- Time gate: `Time[0] < new TimeSpan(13, 30, 0)`
- Cooldown: bar counter since last entry
- Daily loss limit: track cumulative Edge Fade P&L per session

**Run as**: Part of framework strategy.

## STRATEGY 5: IBH Sweep + Failure Fade (SHORT)

### Concept
On balance days, price sometimes sweeps above IBH into overhead liquidity (PDH, London High), but fails to hold above. This trapped long/short-covering creates selling pressure. Enter short on the failure bar.

### When to Trade
- **Day type**: b_day ONLY (23% WR on p_day, do NOT use on p_day)
- **Time**: AM to early PM
- **Frequency**: ~4 trades per 62 sessions (CAUTION: small sample)

### Entry Rules (Step-by-Step)
1. **Day type = b_day** (this is CRITICAL, 23% WR on p_day)
2. **Price sweeps above IBH**: Bar high > IBH, touching PDH, London High, or other overhead liquidity
3. **Failure to close above IBH**: Despite the sweep, the bar closes below IBH
4. **Delta < 0** on the failure bar (sellers stepping in)
5. **Quality >= 2** (volume, wick rejection strength)
6. **Entry**: SHORT at close of failure bar

### Exit Rules
- **Stop**: Sweep high + 15% of IB range
- **Target**: IB midpoint

### What to Look for as a Manual Trader
- **On the chart**: On a balance day, watch for price to poke above IBH. Mark PDH and London High as overhead liquidity targets. When price reaches these levels and produces a long upper wick (rejection), that's the signal.
- **Order flow / Bookmap**: At the sweep high, look for sell imbalance (red delta). Large sell orders should appear at or above IBH. The failure bar should show aggressive selling (negative delta).
- **CVD indicator**: CVD may be rising into the sweep (longs pushing up). When CVD starts declining WHILE price is still near IBH, that's bearish divergence confirming the failure.
- **Key risk**: This is NQ, which has a strong long bias. Only 4 trades in the backtest at 100% WR. Use conservative sizing until more data confirms the edge.

### Performance
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Trades | 4 |
| Win Rate | 100% |
| Expectancy | **$146/trade** |
| Max Drawdown | $0 |
| Note | **Small sample, use conservatively** |

### NinjaTrader Automation
**Partially automatable**. The core logic (IBH sweep detection, delta check, stop/target) is automatable. However, identifying PDH and London High levels requires multi-session data and potentially pre-market level computation. This adds complexity but is feasible.

**Run as**: Part of framework strategy, but can also run standalone with manual level input.

---

## STRATEGY 6: Bear Acceptance Short (SHORT)

### Concept
When a session is bearish (price extends below IBL with conviction), wait for 3+ consecutive bars to close below IBL (acceptance of the lower range). This structural breakdown confirms that the session is trending down, not just testing IBL temporarily.

### When to Trade
- **Day type**: trend_down (extension > 1.0x below IBL) or b_day_bear (extension > 0.5x below IBL)
- **NEVER on b_day or neutral** (14% WR on b_day, 10% WR on neutral)
- **Time**: Before 14:00 ET
- **Frequency**: ~11 trades per 62 sessions

### Entry Rules (Step-by-Step)
1. **Day type = trend_down or b_day_bear** (extension below IBL must be > 0.5x IB)
2. **3+ consecutive bars close below IBL** (acceptance confirmation)
3. **Entry**: SHORT at close of the 3rd acceptance bar

### Exit Rules
- **Stop**: IBL + 25% of IB range (if price reclaims IBL, the thesis is invalid)
- **Target**: IBL - 0.75x IB range (extends the move 0.75x further below IBL)
- **Time**: Before 14:00

### What to Look for as a Manual Trader
- **On the chart**: Mark IBL at 10:30. Wait for price to break below IBL and STAY below for 3+ bars. This is not a quick dip and bounce (that's a B-Day IBL Fade setup). This is a breakdown where bars consistently close below.
- **Day type is EVERYTHING**: Before entering, confirm the day type. If you're unsure whether it's trend_down or b_day, check the IB extension. Extension below IBL must be > 0.5x IB range. On a regular b_day (14% WR for shorts!) or neutral (10% WR!), this trade will LOSE.
- **Order flow**: Look for sustained negative delta (sellers dominating every bar). The 3rd acceptance bar should have strong sell-side volume.
- **CVD indicator**: CVD should be making new lows, confirming the breakdown. If CVD is flat or rising while price is below IBL, the breakdown may fail.
- **HTF confluence (optional, higher conviction)**: Check for 4H bearish FVG, daily bearish FVG, or PDH swept and failed. Sessions with HTF backing drop 2.2x more (245 vs 110 pts average decline).

### Performance
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Trades | 11 |
| Win Rate | 64% |
| Avg Win | $203 |
| Avg Loss | -$107 |
| W:L Ratio | 1.9:1 |
| Expectancy | **$90/trade** |
| Max Drawdown | -$289 |
| Max Consec Loss | 3 |
| Profit Factor | 3.32 |

### Day Type Win Rate Breakdown (CRITICAL)
| Day Type | WR | Net Pts | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| trend_down | 64% | +649 | TRADE |
| b_day_bear | 55% | +275 | TRADE |
| b_day | 14% | -839 | **NEVER SHORT** |
| neutral | 10% | -768 | **NEVER SHORT** |

### NinjaTrader Automation
**Fully automatable**. All inputs are simple:
- IB high/low from first 60 bars
- Extension tracking: `(ibLow - CurrentBar.Low) / ibRange`
- Bar acceptance counter: count consecutive bars with `Close[0] < ibLow`
- Day type from extension ratio
- `EnterShortLimit()` at close of 3rd acceptance bar
- `SetStopLoss()` and `SetProfitTarget()` from IB range calculations

**Run as**: Part of framework strategy. Also viable as standalone strategy since it only requires IB-level data.

## STRATEGY 7: Opening Range Reversal (LONG and SHORT)

### Concept
This strategy trades the ICT "Judas Swing" at market open. In the first 30 minutes (9:30-10:00), price makes a false move in one direction to sweep pre-market liquidity (overnight high/low, Asia session high/low, prior day high/low), then reverses for the real directional move of the day. We enter on the reversal after confirmation from FVG, VWAP alignment, and gap direction.

This strategy trades BEFORE the other 6 strategies activate (9:30-10:30 vs 10:30-16:00), making it fully additive to the existing portfolio.

### When to Trade
- **Time**: 9:30-10:30 ET (opening range period)
- **Best filter**: Entry near overnight high/low sweep with VWAP alignment
- **Frequency**: ~20 trades per 62 sessions (optimized from 97 raw signals)

### Pre-Market Level Computation (Before 9:30)
Before the session opens, compute these reference levels:

| Level | Time Window (ET) | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Overnight High/Low | 18:00 prev day - 9:29 | Full ETH range |
| Asia High/Low | 20:00-00:00 prev day | Asian session range |
| London High/Low | 02:00-05:00 | London session range |
| Pre-Market High/Low | 06:00-09:29 | US pre-market range |
| PDH/PDL | Prev day 9:30-16:00 | Prior day's RTH range |
| PDC | Prev day close | Prior day closing price |

### Entry Model: OR_REVERSAL (The "Judas Swing")
The first 30 minutes of RTH establish an opening range (OR). The key insight is that the OR extreme nearest a pre-market liquidity level is often a FALSE move designed to sweep stops.

**OR_REVERSAL_SHORT (Judas swing up, then reverse down)**:
1. First 30 bars (9:30-9:59) make a high within 30 pts of overnight_high, asia_high, or PDH
2. Price then reverses and closes below OR midpoint
3. This confirms the high was a liquidity sweep, not a genuine breakout
4. Entry: SHORT at close of reversal bar

**OR_REVERSAL_LONG (Judas swing down, then reverse up)**:
1. First 30 bars make a low within 30 pts of overnight_low, asia_low, or PDL
2. Price then reverses and closes above OR midpoint
3. This confirms the low was a liquidity sweep, not a genuine breakdown
4. Entry: LONG at close of reversal bar

### Optimized Filters (v2 Analysis Results)

The raw OR_REVERSAL model generates 50+ trades at 57% WR. These filters narrow to 20 high-quality trades at 80% WR:

| Filter | Impact | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Overnight H/L sweep** | 73-86% WR (best) | Overnight levels are the highest-quality liquidity pools |
| **VWAP aligned** | Entry near VWAP = 80% WR | VWAP acts as institutional fair value; entries near VWAP have better R:R |
| **Gap aligned** | 62% WR vs 38% unaligned | Gap down + LONG aligned = price gapped into liquidity, reversal is the real move |
| **FVG confirmation** | 56% WR vs 29% without | 5-min or 15-min FVG in reversal direction confirms institutional intent |
| **NOT fade opening drive** | Fade = 40% WR | Fading the opening drive is a losing approach; trade WITH the reversal |

**Best combination**: Overnight sweep + VWAP aligned = 20 trades, 80% WR, $190/trade, -$407 MaxDD, PF 6.3

### Exit Rules
- **Stop**: Sweep extreme + 15% of OR range (just beyond the false move extreme)
- **Target**: 2R (risk = entry to stop; target = 2x risk in direction of trade)
- **EOD**: Close any remaining position at 15:59

### What to Look for as a Manual Trader

**Before the open (8:30-9:29)**:
1. Mark overnight high/low on the chart (these are your primary liquidity targets)
2. Note the gap: Is price opening above or below yesterday's close?
3. Check NQ vs ES: Are they aligned? If ES is making a lower low while NQ holds, that's bullish SMT

**During the opening range (9:30-10:00)**:
1. Watch the first 15-30 minutes. Is price driving toward overnight high or overnight low?
2. **Judas swing identification**: If price drives toward overnight high and touches it, that's a potential Judas swing up. If it drives toward overnight low and touches it, potential Judas swing down.
3. **Wait for reversal**: Do NOT fade immediately. Wait for price to reverse through OR midpoint (confirms the move was false).

**Entry confirmation (10:00-10:30)**:
1. **FVG check**: On a 5-min chart, has a Fair Value Gap formed in the reversal direction? A bull FVG = gap up on 5-min bars (bar 3 low > bar 1 high). This confirms institutional buying.
2. **VWAP**: Is entry near VWAP? Entries within 20 pts of VWAP have 80% WR. Entries far from VWAP are lower quality.
3. **Gap alignment**: If there was a gap down and you're going LONG, that's aligned (gap swept downside liquidity, now reversing). If gap up and going SHORT, aligned.
4. **Delta at entry**: On the entry bar, delta should confirm direction (positive for LONG, negative for SHORT).

**Order flow specifics**:
- **Bookmap heatmap**: At the sweep level (overnight H/L), look for the heatmap to show a cluster of orders that got absorbed. Large resting orders at overnight levels that get eaten by market orders, but price fails to continue = institutional absorption.
- **CVD at entry**: After the Judas swing (false move), CVD should start diverging from price. For example, if price swept overnight low (false break down), CVD should start rising even as price initially stays low. This CVD divergence = smart money accumulating.
- **Footprint chart**: On the reversal bar, the footprint should show aggressive buying (for LONG) or selling (for SHORT) with significant volume.

### SMT Divergence (Cross-Instrument Confirmation)

SMT (Smart Money Technique) divergence detects when correlated instruments (NQ, ES, YM) diverge at key levels:

**Bullish SMT**: NQ makes a new low but ES holds a higher low (or vice versa). This means one instrument's breakdown is "fake" because the other refuses to confirm it.

**Bearish SMT**: NQ makes a new high but ES holds a lower high. The breakout is not confirmed across instruments.

**How to use**: SMT is a confluence factor, not a primary filter. In our backtest, SMT is present 98% of sessions (too frequent to be a filter). However, when SMT aligns with the OR reversal direction, conviction is higher. Triple SMT (2+ of NQ/ES/YM pairs diverging) is a stronger signal.

**In NinjaTrader**: Requires loading ES and YM data alongside NQ. Use `AddDataSeries()` to add ES and YM 1-min bars, then compare running highs/lows during the opening range.

| OR_REVERSAL_LONG | 24 | 57% | $52 | overnight_low (73% WR) |
| VWAP_RECLAIM_LONG | 24 | 46% | -$2 | **CUT (no edge)** |
| VWAP_RECLAIM_SHORT | 23 | 44% | -$3 | **CUT (no edge)** |

**Key finding**: VWAP_RECLAIM models have ZERO edge and were removed from the optimized version. Only OR_REVERSAL models are traded.

### Volume Profile Zone Impact (Prior Day)
| VP Zone | WR | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Near HVN | 54% | Better for OR (HVN = magnet for rotation) |
| Near LVN | 36% | Bad for OR (opposite of Edge Fade!) |
| NONE | 60% | Clean levels, no VP interference |

This is opposite to Edge Fade where LVN is better. For opening range, HVN provides a rotation anchor that supports mean reversion.

### NinjaTrader Automation
**Partially automatable**. Core logic is automatable:
- Pre-market levels: Compute overnight H/L, Asia H/L from ETH bars using `AddDataSeries()` with session templates
- OR high/low from first 30 bars
- Sweep detection: `High[0] >= overnightHigh - 30` within first 30 bars
- Reversal detection: `Close[0] < orMid` after sweep
- VWAP alignment: `Math.Abs(Close[0] - CurrentDayOHL().VWAP) < 20`
- FVG detection: Compare 5-min bar highs/lows for gaps

**Complexity**: Requires multi-instrument data (ES, YM) for SMT divergence. NinjaTrader supports this via `AddDataSeries(BarsPeriodType.Minute, 1)` for ES and YM contracts. However, managing 3 data series adds code complexity.

**Recommendation**: Implement core OR_REVERSAL logic as automated. Add SMT as manual overlay until validated with more data.

**Run as**: Standalone strategy (runs 9:30-10:30, before framework strategies activate at 10:30). Can also integrate into framework with time-gating.

## Framework vs Standalone Execution

### Recommended Architecture

```
[Framework Strategy - MasterController.cs]
|
|-- 9:30-10:30: Opening Range Reversal (Strategy 7)
|     |-- Compute pre-market levels at 9:30
|     |-- Detect OR reversal in real-time
|     |-- Entry/exit management for OR trades
|     |-- Close OR positions by 10:30 if still open
|
|-- 10:30-16:00: Intraday Dalton Strategies (Strategies 1-6)
      |-- Compute IB at 10:30
      |-- Classify day type from IB extension
      |-- Route to applicable strategy based on day type:
      |     |-- trend_up/p_day -> Strategy 1/2 (VWAP pullback)
      |     |-- b_day + IBL touch -> Strategy 3 (IBL Fade)
      |     |-- b_day/neutral + edge zone -> Strategy 4 (Edge Fade)
      |     |-- b_day + IBH sweep failure -> Strategy 5 (IBH Sweep)
      |     |-- trend_down/b_day_bear -> Strategy 6 (Bear Short)
      |-- Shared position management
      |-- EOD exit at 15:59
```

### Individual vs Framework

| Strategy | Can Run Standalone? | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Trend Day Bull | Yes, but shares IB/day type with #2 | Framework |
| 2. P-Day | Yes, but shares IB/day type with #1 | Framework |
| 3. B-Day IBL Fade | Yes (only needs IB + confidence) | Framework |
| 4. Edge Fade | Yes (only needs IB + extension) | Framework |
| 5. IBH Sweep+Fail | Yes, but needs day type filter | Framework |
| 6. Bear Accept Short | Yes (only needs IB + extension) | Framework or Standalone |
| 7. OR Reversal | **Yes (different time window)** | **Standalone or Framework** |

**Key recommendation**: Strategy 7 (Opening Range) should be deployable as either standalone or framework. It operates in a different time window (9:30-10:30) than strategies 1-6 (10:30-16:00), so there's no conflict. Running it standalone makes it simpler to implement first while the framework is built.

## Risk Management

### Portfolio Limits (Evaluation)

| Limit | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Max Contracts | 1 MNQ | Build buffer before scaling |
| Daily Edge Fade Loss | -$400 (2 stops) | Stop Edge Fade after 2 losses in a session |
| Max Drawdown Budget | $4,500 trailing (Tradeify) | Portfolio max DD of -$407 = 9% of budget |
| Session Time | 9:30-16:00 | Full session with OR + Intraday |

### Position Sizing (Funded Accounts)

| Phase | Buffer | Size | A Setups | B Setups |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | $0-$3,000 | 1 MNQ | 1 MNQ | 1 MNQ |
| Phase 2 | $3,000-$6,000 | 1-2 MNQ | 2 MNQ | 1 MNQ |
| Phase 3 | $6,000+ | 2-3 MNQ | 3 MNQ | 2 MNQ |

**A Setups** (highest conviction): B-Day IBL Fade (100% WR), Edge Fade Optimized (94% WR), OR Reversal with overnight sweep + VWAP (80% WR)
**B Setups** (solid but lower): Trend Bull/P-Day (75% WR), Bear Accept Short (64% WR)

### Prop Firm Eval (Tradeify $150K Select Flex)

- **Profit Target**: $9,000
- **Trailing Drawdown**: $4,500 (EOD)
- **With 72 trades / 62 sessions**: ~1.2 trades/day, $243 avg expectancy
- **Trades to hit target**: ~37 trades
- **Timeline**: ~4-5 weeks at current frequency
- **Max DD risk**: -$407 = 9% of DD allowance (very safe)

## 10 Rules You Must Never Break

1. **NEVER short on b_day or neutral** (0-14% WR on NQ)
2. **NEVER enter Edge Fade after 13:30** (0% WR at 13:30-14:00, PM morph kills mean reversion)
3. **NEVER enter Edge Fade when IB > 200 pts** (0-36% WR on wide IB)
4. **NEVER enter Edge Fade on bearish days** (ext_down > 0.3x = 37% WR vs 82%)
5. **NEVER use FVG as standalone entry on 1-min bars** (16% WR, counter-indicator)
6. **NEVER use trailing stops on VWAP pullback entries** (reduces P&L 50-80%)
7. **NEVER use CVDFilter on B-Day trades** (kills B-Day entries which naturally have CVD < MA)
8. **Day type is THE filter for all entries** - classify the day FIRST, then pick the strategy
9. **EOD exit captures the most P&L** for trend/p-day strategies
10. **Pre-entry delta < -500 on VWAP pullbacks = skip** (aggressive selling, losers avg -819 to -938)

## Appendix A: NinjaTrader Implementation Checklist

### Shared Components (Framework)
- [ ] IB calculator (first 60 bars high/low/mid/range)
- [ ] Day type classifier (extension ratio from IB)
- [ ] Extension tracker (running max extension above IBH and below IBL)
- [ ] VWAP reference (built-in NinjaTrader indicator)
- [ ] Delta/volume/imbalance from volumetric bar data
- [ ] Position manager (max 1 position per strategy at a time)
- [ ] EOD exit timer (force close at 15:59)
- [ ] Session state reset at 9:30

### Strategy-Specific Components
- [ ] **Trend Bull/P-Day**: Acceptance counter (bars above IBH), VWAP pullback detection, pre-delta sum
- [ ] **B-Day IBL Fade**: b_day confidence score, IBL touch detection, quality scorer
- [ ] **Edge Fade**: Edge zone check (lower 25% IB), 3-filter gate, cooldown counter, daily loss limit
- [ ] **IBH Sweep+Fail**: Sweep detection (high > IBH + liquidity), failure bar check
- [ ] **Bear Accept Short**: Acceptance counter (bars below IBL), day type filter
- [ ] **OR Reversal**: Pre-market level computation, OR high/low tracking, reversal detection, FVG on 5-min bars, VWAP alignment, multi-instrument data series (ES, YM)

### Testing Priority
1. Edge Fade (highest volume, 17 trades, most P&L)
2. Trend Bull + P-Day (well-understood VWAP pullback)
3. B-Day IBL Fade (highest expectancy per trade)
4. Bear Accept Short (only short strategy with clean automation)
5. OR Reversal (new strategy, needs more validation)
6. IBH Sweep+Fail (smallest sample, lowest priority)
