## 1. Solo Strategy Accounts

Each strategy was run in its own isolated `BacktestEngine` + `PositionManager` with zero interaction between strategies. Results match portfolio exactly -- **zero position conflicts across 259 sessions**.

### 1.1 Solo Performance Summary

| Strategy | Trades | Sessions | WR | Net P&L | $/trade | PF | Max DD | Consec Loss | Win Months | Lose Months |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **OR Reversal** | **65** | **65/259** | **61.5%** | **$13,962** | **$215** | **3.34** | **$1,363** | **4** | **10/13** | **3/13** |
| **Edge Fade** | **96** | **44/259** | **56.2%** | **$8,434** | **$88** | **1.62** | **$2,374** | **5** | **8/13** | **5/13** |
| B-Day | 19 | 19/259 | 42.1% | $758 | $40 | 1.19 | $3,375 | 8 | 4/9 | 5/9 |
| P-Day | 23 | 23/259 | 34.8% | -$514 | -$22 | 0.77 | $1,585 | 7 | 3/9 | 6/9 |
| Trend Bull | 21 | 21/259 | 38.1% | -$589 | -$28 | 0.67 | $1,651 | 7 | 3/9 | 6/9 |
| Bear Accept | 58 | 58/259 | 67.2% | -$2,553 | -$44 | 0.56 | $3,001 | 3 | 3/13 | 10/13 |
| IBH Sweep | 1 | 1/259 | 0.0% | -$37 | -$37 | 0.00 | $37 | 1 | 0/1 | 1/1 |

### 1.2 Risk & Expectancy Per Strategy

| Strategy | Avg Risk | Avg Winner | Avg Loser | Win R | Loss R | R Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **OR Reversal** | 66pt ($132) | $498 | -$239 | +0.91R | -0.72R | **1.27** |
| **Edge Fade** | 58pt ($117) | $410 | -$326 | +0.82R | -0.96R | 0.86 |
| B-Day | 29pt ($59) | $599 | -$367 | +1.43R | -0.94R | 1.52 |
| Bear Accept | 138pt ($275) | $82 | -$304 | +0.26R | -0.85R | **0.30** |
| P-Day | 56pt ($111) | $217 | -$150 | +0.02R | -0.50R | 0.04 |
| Trend Bull | 54pt ($107) | $149 | -$137 | +0.04R | -0.49R | 0.07 |

**Key insight:** Only OR Reversal has a favorable R:R ratio (>1.0). B-Day has the best ratio (1.52) but 42% WR and 8 consecutive losses make it dangerous. Bear Accept's 0.30 ratio means it needs 77% WR to break even -- it only achieves 67%.

## 2. Solo Monthly Breakdown

### 2.1 OR Reversal (STAR -- $13,962)

| Month | Trades | WR | Net P&L | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-02 | 3 | 100% | $2,143 | Strong start |
| 2025-03 | 7 | 57% | $996 | Choppy but profitable |
| 2025-04 | 3 | 100% | $1,617 | Perfect month |
| 2025-05 | 4 | 100% | $2,614 | Best month |
| 2025-06 | 2 | 0% | -$582 | Low vol, no opportunity |
| 2025-07 | 9 | 56% | $940 | Busy, moderate |
| 2025-08 | 4 | 25% | -$104 | Rare losing month |
| 2025-09 | 5 | 60% | $1,710 | Strong recovery |
| 2025-10 | 2 | 100% | $686 | Few trades but clean |
| 2025-11 | 4 | 25% | -$261 | DD contributor |
| 2025-12 | 11 | 64% | $1,919 | High volume, strong |
| 2026-01 | 4 | 50% | $679 | Steady |
| 2026-02 | 7 | 71% | $1,603 | Strong close |

**Only 3 losing months** (Jun, Aug, Nov) -- all shallow. Works across ALL volatility regimes except LOW vol.

### 2.2 Edge Fade (WORKHORSE -- $8,434)

| Month | Trades | WR | Net P&L | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-02 | 11 | 45% | $597 | Busy, mixed |
| 2025-03 | 8 | 50% | $896 | Solid |
| 2025-04 | 1 | 0% | -$376 | Quiet month |
| 2025-05 | 5 | 20% | -$1,093 | **Worst month -- 4/5 full stops** |
| 2025-06 | 2 | 100% | $1,123 | Low vol but hit |
| 2025-07 | 2 | 0% | -$689 | Low vol failure |
| 2025-08 | 9 | 89% | $1,986 | **Explosive -- vol returning** |
| 2025-09 | 5 | 60% | $698 | Steady |
| 2025-10 | 7 | 43% | -$324 | Choppy |
| 2025-11 | 16 | 50% | $999 | High volume |
| 2025-12 | 14 | 93% | $4,418 | **EXTRAORDINARY -- 93% WR** |
| 2026-01 | 10 | 50% | $542 | Mixed |
| 2026-02 | 6 | 33% | -$343 | Extreme vol hurts |

**Dec 2025 alone = $4,418** (52% of annual P&L). Thrives in NORMAL+HIGH vol, struggles in MED.

### 2.3 B-Day (MARGINAL -- $758)

| Month | Trades | WR | Net P&L | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-02 | 1 | 0% | -$391 | |
| 2025-03 | 3 | 0% | -$1,191 | **3 full stops in a row** |
| 2025-04 | 3 | 0% | -$786 | More full stops |
| 2025-05 | 2 | 50% | $38 | Break-even |
| 2025-06 | 1 | 0% | -$439 | |
| 2025-11 | 3 | 33% | -$607 | |
| 2025-12 | 2 | 100% | $727 | |
| 2026-01 | 1 | 100% | $498 | |
| 2026-02 | 3 | 100% | $2,908 | **Saved the year** |

**Feb 2026 alone ($2,908) rescued this strategy from negative.** Without Feb 2026, B-Day is -$2,150. Extremely streaky -- 8 consecutive losses then 6 consecutive wins.

### 2.4 Bear Accept (STRUCTURAL LOSER -- -$2,553)

| Month | Trades | WR | Net P&L | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-02 | 2 | 50% | -$53 | |
| 2025-03 | 7 | 71% | -$318 | **71% WR but still lost** |
| 2025-04 | 9 | 78% | $94 | 78% WR for $94 |
| 2025-05 | 5 | 40% | -$850 | |
| 2025-06 | 3 | 67% | -$172 | |
| 2025-07 | 5 | 80% | -$129 | **80% WR and STILL lost** |
| 2025-08 | 4 | 75% | -$26 | |
| 2025-09 | 4 | 50% | -$571 | |
| 2025-10 | 8 | 75% | -$207 | |
| 2025-11 | 4 | 50% | -$398 | |
| 2025-12 | 2 | 50% | $20 | |
| 2026-01 | 3 | 67% | -$170 | |
| 2026-02 | 2 | 100% | $227 | |

**Lost money in 10 of 13 months despite 67% overall WR.** This is the textbook inverted R:R problem -- wins average $82, losses average $304. No amount of management fixes this.

### 2.5 P-Day & Trend Bull (CHRONIC LOSERS)

Both strategies share the same fundamental flaw: near-zero R on winners (+0.02R and +0.04R respectively). They only profit via tiny EOD grind exits, never hit their targets.

- P-Day: 6 losing months out of 9, max 7 consecutive losses
- Trend Bull: 6 losing months out of 9, max 7 consecutive losses
- Both only activate Nov-Feb (regime gates block Jul-Oct)
- Combined drag: -$1,103

## 3. Prop Firm Viability Analysis

### 3.1 Solo Strategy vs $4,500 DD Limit

| Strategy | Net P&L | Max DD | DD/Limit | Hits $9K? | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **OR Reversal** | **$13,962** | **$1,363** | **30%** | **YES** | **PASSES** |
| Edge Fade | $8,434 | $2,374 | 53% | NO ($566 short) | TOO SLOW |
| B-Day | $758 | $3,375 | 75% | NO | TOO SLOW |
| Bear Accept | -$2,553 | $3,001 | 67% | NO | LOSES |
| P-Day | -$514 | $1,585 | 35% | NO | LOSES |
| Trend Bull | -$589 | $1,651 | 37% | NO | LOSES |

**Only OR Reversal passes the prop firm solo**, with massive headroom (DD uses only 30% of limit).

### 3.2 Combined Strategy Accounts

| Combo | Trades | Net P&L | Max DD | DD/Limit | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **OR Rev + Edge Fade** | **161** | **$22,396** | **$2,262** | **50%** | **PASSES** |
| OR + Edge + B-Day | 180 | $23,154 | $2,868 | 64% | PASSES |
| All 7 | 283 | $19,462 | $3,334 | 74% | PASSES (tight) |

**Adding losing strategies reduces net P&L by $2,934 and nearly doubles the DD.**

### 3.3 Position Sizing

| Sizing | Expected P&L | Expected Max DD | DD/Limit | Safe? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 MNQ (all 7) | $19,462 | $3,334 | 74% | Yes but tight |
| 1 MNQ (OR+Edge) | $22,396 | $2,262 | 50% | **Yes -- comfortable** |
| 2 MNQ (all 7) | $38,923 | $6,667 | 148% | **NO -- blows limit** |
| 2 MNQ (OR+Edge) | $44,792 | $4,524 | 101% | **NO -- razor edge** |

**Recommendation: 1 MNQ with OR Rev + Edge Fade only.** Scale to 2 MNQ only after $3K+ equity buffer.

## 4. When-to-Avoid Analysis

### 4.1 IB Range Filters

| Filter | Trades | Removed | WR | Net P&L | $/trade | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BASELINE | 283 | 0 | 55.5% | $19,462 | $69 | -- |
| **IB > 100 (skip low vol)** | **255** | **28** | **56.9%** | **$21,539** | **$84** | **+$2,077** |
| IB > 75 | 278 | 5 | 55.8% | $20,427 | $73 | +$966 |
| IB < 400 (skip extreme) | 268 | 15 | 55.6% | $17,982 | $67 | -$1,479 |
| IB < 350 | 251 | 32 | 53.0% | $8,370 | $33 | **-$11,092** |
| IB < 300 | 235 | 48 | 54.5% | $10,337 | $44 | -$9,124 |
| IB < 250 | 187 | 96 | 55.1% | $7,314 | $39 | -$12,147 |

**CRITICAL FINDING: DO NOT cap high IB.** Our best profits come from HIGH volatility (IB > 250). Cutting IB < 350 alone costs $11,092. The only beneficial filter is removing LOW vol (IB < 100).

### 4.2 Sit Out After Bad Day

| Filter | Trades | WR | Net P&L | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Skip after $500 loss day | 261 | 55.2% | $17,296 | -$2,165 |
| Skip after $750 loss day | 271 | 54.2% | $15,829 | -$3,632 |
| Skip after $1000 loss day | 275 | 54.2% | $15,903 | -$3,559 |
| Skip after $1500 loss day | 280 | 55.0% | $17,807 | -$1,655 |

**Every "skip after bad day" filter HURTS.** Recovery days are profitable -- sitting out misses the bounce-back.

### 4.3 Seasonal Filters

| Filter | Trades | WR | Net P&L | $/trade | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Skip March | 247 | 57.5% | $20,208 | $82 | +$746 |
| Skip June | 273 | 56.0% | $19,967 | $73 | +$505 |
| Skip Mar+Jun | 237 | 58.2% | $20,713 | $87 | +$1,251 |
| **Skip Mar-Jun (tariff chaos)** | **191** | **61.8%** | **$20,624** | **$108** | **+$1,162** |
| Only Nov-Feb | 127 | 61.4% | $16,654 | $131 | -$2,808 |

Skipping the tariff chaos period (Mar-Jun) improves expectancy to $108/trade (+57%) but only adds $1,162 to net P&L because we actually made some money during that period. **Not worth implementing as a hard rule** -- better to filter by IB range which achieves the same effect dynamically.

### 4.4 Worst/Best Day Removal (Fragility Test)

| Filter | Trades | WR | Net P&L | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Remove worst 5 days | 262 | 59.5% | $26,044 | +$6,583 |
| Remove worst 10 days | 247 | 62.3% | $30,380 | +$10,918 |
| Remove worst 20 days | 225 | 67.6% | $35,911 | +$16,450 |
| Remove best 5 days | 265 | 52.8% | $8,286 | -$11,176 |
| **Remove best 10 days** | **245** | **49.4%** | **$591** | **-$18,870** |

**The portfolio is FRAGILE to its best days.** Removing the top 10 trading days wipes out 97% of profits ($591 left from $19,462). This means ~10 days drive the entire year's returns. Conversely, the worst 10 days only cost $10,918 -- the system is asymmetric in a good way (wins > losses on extreme days).

## 5. Per-Strategy Optimal IB Regime

### 5.1 Regime Performance Matrix

| Strategy | LOW (<100) | MED (100-150) | NORMAL (150-250) | HIGH (>250) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **B-Day** | -$439 AVOID | $584 BEST | -$399 AVOID | $1,012 BEST |
| **Bear Accept** | -$1,296 AVOID | -$85 | -$1,179 AVOID | $7 |
| **Edge Fade** | 0 trades | -$1,052 AVOID | $4,936 BEST | $4,550 BEST |
| **OR Reversal** | -$68 | $3,707 BEST | $3,546 BEST | $6,776 BEST |
| **P-Day** | -$175 | $281 | -$520 AVOID | -$99 |
| **Trend Bull** | -$99 | $281 | -$671 AVOID | -$99 |

### 5.2 Recommended Regime Filters

| Strategy | Run In | Avoid | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| B-Day | MED + HIGH only | LOW, NORMAL | Cuts -$838 in losses |
| Edge Fade | NORMAL + HIGH only | MED | Cuts -$1,052 in losses |
| OR Reversal | MED + NORMAL + HIGH | LOW | Cuts -$68 (minimal) |
| Bear Accept | **DROP ENTIRELY** | All | Saves $2,553 |
| P-Day | MED only (4 trades) | All others | Not worth running |
| Trend Bull | MED only (4 trades) | All others | Not worth running |

## 6. Strategy Weakness Deep Dive

### 6.1 Bear Accept -- Structural R:R Failure
- **Problem:** Avg win +0.26R ($82) vs avg loss -0.85R ($304) = 0.30 ratio
- **Why:** Targets are 0.75x IB range (small), stops are 0.25x IB above IBL (large)
- **Math:** Needs 77% WR to break even, only achieves 67%
- **Monthly proof:** Lost money in 10/13 months DESPITE winning 67% of trades
- **Verdict:** Unfixable with trade management. Either redesign R:R or drop.

### 6.2 P-Day & Trend Bull -- Zero-R Winners
- **Problem:** Avg win is +0.02R and +0.04R -- essentially scratch trades
- **Why:** Strategies require VWAP pullback entry. On trend days, VWAP lags 100+ pts behind price. Entries happen late, near exhaustion.
- **Exit analysis:** Wins come ONLY from EOD exits (grinding $8-15/trade). Never hit target.
- **Loss profile:** 7 consecutive losses for both strategies
- **Verdict:** VWAP alignment needs fundamental rework (use slope instead of proximity) or drop.

### 6.3 B-Day -- Streaky, Regime-Dependent
- **Problem:** 8 consecutive losses (Feb-Jun), then 6 consecutive wins (Dec-Feb)
- **Why:** B-Day takes IB breakouts with tight stops (29pt avg). In choppy/low-vol markets, these reverse through stop. In trending/high-vol, they extend far.
- **Feb 2026 saved the year:** $2,908 in one month (3 trades, 100% WR). Without it, B-Day is -$2,150.
- **Verdict:** Only trade in MED+HIGH vol. Highly regime-dependent.

### 6.4 Edge Fade -- Inverted R:R Compensated by Volume
- **Problem:** Avg win +0.82R vs avg loss -0.96R = 0.86 ratio (slightly inverted)
- **Why:** Mean-reversion entries in IB edge zones. When the move fails, full stop. When it works, captures ~80% of the extension.
- **Compensator:** 96 trades/year and 56% WR overcome the inverted R:R
- **Achilles heel:** MED vol (100-150 IB) produces -$1,052. Moves don't develop enough.
- **Verdict:** Healthy but add MED vol filter.

### 6.5 OR Reversal -- Near-Perfect, Fix LONG Side
- **Problem:** LONG side only 48% WR ($2,567) vs SHORT 72% WR ($11,395)
- **Why:** Market has structural downward bias during reversals (gap-and-fail). Long reversals from lows face stronger resistance.
- **Only weakness:** LOW vol sessions (-$68, 9 trades, 33% WR)
- **Verdict:** Consider SHORT-only mode or tighter LONG entry criteria.

## 7. Recommended Portfolio Configuration

### 7.1 Conservative (Prop Firm Optimal)
**OR Reversal + Edge Fade only**
- 161 trades | $22,396 net | $139/trade | DD $2,262 (50% of limit)
- Passes prop firm with massive headroom
- 2 complementary strategies: momentum reversal + mean reversion

### 7.2 Moderate
**OR Reversal + Edge Fade + B-Day (MED+HIGH vol only)**
- ~175 trades | ~$23,000 net | DD ~$2,900 (64% of limit)
- B-Day adds upside in high-vol months but streaky

### 7.3 Current (All 7)
- 283 trades | $19,462 net | $69/trade | DD $3,334 (74% of limit)
- Bear Accept, P-Day, Trend Bull are net drags
- Only recommended if strategies will be improved

### 7.4 Implementation Filters
If keeping all strategies, apply per-strategy IB regime filters:
1. B-Day: only MED+HIGH (IB >= 100)
2. Edge Fade: only NORMAL+HIGH (IB >= 150)
3. OR Reversal: skip LOW (IB >= 100)
4. Bear Accept: DROP or HIGH only
5. P-Day/Trend Bull: DROP or MED only

---

## 8. Key Conclusions

1. **OR Reversal is the only strategy that justifies itself solo** -- passes prop firm, 10/13 winning months, $215/trade expectancy, PF 3.34
2. **Edge Fade is a strong #2** -- 96 trades, consistent, $88/trade, but needs $566 more to pass prop firm solo
3. **Bear Accept is structurally broken** -- 67% WR means nothing with 0.30 R:R ratio. Lost 10/13 months.
4. **P-Day and Trend Bull are zombie strategies** -- near-zero R on wins, 7 consecutive losses, only profit via EOD grind
5. **B-Day is a lottery ticket** -- one extraordinary month (Feb 2026) masks a losing strategy
6. **HIGH volatility is our friend** -- DO NOT cap IB range. Our best profits come from IB > 250.
7. **LOW volatility is the enemy** -- IB > 100 filter adds $2,077 with zero cost
8. **Don't sit out after bad days** -- recovery trades are profitable
9. **The portfolio is top-heavy** -- 10 best days = 97% of annual profits. Protect those days.
10. **Optimal live config: OR Rev + Edge Fade at 1 MNQ** -- $22,396 net, DD 50% of prop firm limit
