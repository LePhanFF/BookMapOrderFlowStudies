# VA Edge Fade Study — Fading Failed Breakouts at Value Area Boundaries

**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Data:** 259 RTH sessions (11.8 months), MNQ 5 contracts
**Script:** `study_va_edge_fade.py`
**Events detected:** 620 VA edge poke/rejection events

---

## Setup Description

**This is NOT the 80P Rule.** The 80P rule trades when price *opens outside* VA and reverts.
This study trades when price *approaches the VA boundary from inside/near*, **pokes outside** (sweep/liquidity grab), and **fails** — a classic failed breakout / sweep-to-fail pattern.

**Trade 1 (First Touch):** First time price pokes outside VA edge, shows rejection, fade back into VA.
**Trade 2 (Second Test):** Price retests the same VA edge after initial rejection, fails again.

## Event Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total poke/rejection events | 620 |
| 1st poke (first touch) | 191 |
| 2nd poke (retest) | 140 |
| 3rd+ poke | 289 |
| VAH fades (SHORT) | 294 |
| VAL fades (LONG) | 326 |
| Inversion candle signals | 497 |
| 2x 5-min close signals | 496 |

**Sweep depth** (how far price pokes beyond VA edge):
- Mean: 19.0 pts | Median: 12.1 pts
- 75th percentile: 24.1 pts | 90th: 40.4 pts

**ATR at entry:** Mean 23.7 pts | Median 21.1 pts

---

## Entry Models Tested

1. **Inversion Candle (5-min):** Bearish/bullish reversal candle — high pokes above VAH but close below VAH and below open (SHORT), or low pokes below VAL but close above VAL and above open (LONG)
2. **2x 5-min Close:** Two consecutive 5-min candles close back inside VA after the poke
3. **Limit at Sweep Extreme:** Limit order at the sweep high/low on 2nd test (double top/bottom)
4. **Limit at VA Edge:** Limit order at exact VAH/VAL on retest

## Stop Models Tested

1. **2 ATR** — 2x ATR(14) from entry (~46 pts median)
2. **80-point fixed** — constant 80pt stop
3. **VA Edge + 10pt** — stop just beyond the VA boundary
4. **Swing** — 5-min candle extreme + 5pt buffer

## Target Models Tested

1. **0.2 ATR trail** — shallow trailing stop (scalp)
2. **0.5 ATR trail** — moderate trail
3. **1R, 2R, 4R** — fixed risk-multiple targets
4. **POC, Mid-VA, Opposite VA** — structural targets

## Key Findings

### 1. Limit Edge Entry on 2nd Test Dominates

The **limit order at VA edge on retest** is the clear winner across all stop types. This entry model:
- Consistently produces 55-66% WR depending on stop
- Highest PF across all entry models (1.35-1.73 with 2 ATR stop)
- $1,000-$1,370/mo across multiple target types
- **This is the double top/bottom with a limit order — wait for price to come back to the edge, enter with a limit**

### 2. 2 ATR Stop vs 80-Point Stop

| Stop | Avg Risk | Best $/Mo | Best PF | Verdict |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|---------|
| 2 ATR | 46p | $1,309 (POC) | 1.63 | **Winner** — tighter, better PF |
| 80pt | 80p | $1,367 (1R) | 1.47 | Higher $ but lower PF, too wide |
| VA Edge+10 | 33p | $1,381 (2R combined) | 1.25 | Interesting with 2x5m combined |
| Swing | 57p | $1,453 (4R) | 1.30 | Highest $ but low WR (30%) |

**Conclusion: 2 ATR stop is optimal.** Median 46pt risk provides the best balance. 80pt stop is oversized for most setups (median sweep is only 12pt), giving back too much edge. VA Edge stop is too tight for most entries (gets chopped out).

### 3. Shallow Trail (0.2 ATR) is a Consistent Scalp Edge

The **0.2 ATR trailing stop** produces remarkably consistent results across ALL entry models:
- 1st Touch Inversion: 59.6% WR, PF 1.57
- 1st Touch 2x5m: 66.9% WR, PF 5.42
- 2nd Test Limit Edge: 65.0% WR, PF 2.83
- **1st SHORT 2x5m: 70.0% WR, PF 7.28** (best PF in the entire study)

But $ per month is limited ($270-$632) because targets are small (~$80-100/trade).

**0.5 ATR trail consistently FAILS** — almost every configuration is below breakeven. This is a dead zone: too wide to capture the quick scalp, too tight for real trend moves.

### 4. Shorts Outperform Longs on First Touch

| Direction | 0.2 ATR Trail WR | 0.2 ATR PF | POC WR | POC PF |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|--------|--------|
| SHORT (1st) | 70.0% | 7.28 | 63.2% | 1.17 |
| LONG (1st) | ~63% | ~3.5 | ~53% | ~1.1 |

SHORT fades at VAH on first touch produce the cleanest edge. This aligns with NQ's tendency for upside liquidity sweeps to fail (institutions sell the poke).

### 5. Second Test Limit Sweep + VA Edge Stop = Highest WR System

**72.4% WR with PF 5.38** — 105 trades, $533/mo. The setup:
- Wait for 2nd test of VA edge
- Place limit at the sweep extreme (double top/bottom)
- Stop at VA edge + 10pt (very tight, ~9pt avg risk)
- Target 1R

This is essentially a micro-scalp: 9pt risk, 9pt reward, 72% hit rate. The stop is incredibly tight because you're entering right at the sweep extreme with a stop just inside the VA boundary. **Caveat:** 9pt risk = very sensitive to slippage and execution.

### 6. Best "Real-World Tradeable" Configurations

For a human trader who wants a balanced setup (not too many trades, reasonable WR, good PF):

**Config A — Income Machine (High Frequency):**
```
Entry: 2x5min close, 1st + 2nd poke combined
Stop:  2 ATR
Target: 0.2 ATR trail
Result: 257 trades (21.8/mo), 62.6% WR, PF 4.60, $913/mo
```
- Shallow scalps, very high WR, manageable risk
- Trade ~1x/day, capture small moves

**Config B — Balanced Edge (Best Risk-Adjusted):**
```
Entry: Limit at VA edge, 2nd test only
Stop:  2 ATR
Target: POC
Result: 120 trades (10.2/mo), 55.0% WR, PF 1.63, $1,309/mo
```
- Wait for retest, enter with limit, target POC
- ~2.5 trades/week, solid PF

**Config C — High WR Specialist:**
```
Entry: Limit at VA edge, 2nd test only
Stop:  Swing (candle extreme + 5pt)
Target: 1R
Result: 120 trades (10.2/mo), 70.0% WR, PF 2.25, $813/mo
```
- 70% WR with swing stops — very psychologically comfortable
- Small targets (1R of 21pt avg = ~42pt target), quick trades

**Config D — Max $ (Aggressive):**
```
Entry: Inversion candle, 1st touch
Stop:  Swing
Target: 4R
Result: 156 trades (13.3/mo), 30.1% WR, PF 1.30, $1,453/mo
```
- Low WR but big winners ($2k-5k) pay for frequent small losses
- Requires strong discipline to handle losing streaks

## Comparison to Existing 80P Rule Results

| Strategy | Best Config | $/Mo | WR | PF | Trades/Mo |
|----------|-------------|------|----|----|-----------|
| **80P Rule** (opens outside VA) | Limit 50% VA + 4R | $1,922 | 44.7% | 2.57 | 4.0 |
| **80P Rule** (100% retest + 2R) | Double top/bottom | $915 | 65.7% | 3.45 | 3.0 |
| **VA Edge Fade** (limit edge + 2ATR + POC) | 2nd test retest | $1,309 | 55.0% | 1.63 | 10.2 |
| **VA Edge Fade** (2x5m + 2ATR + 0.2 trail) | Combined 1st+2nd | $913 | 62.6% | 4.60 | 21.8 |
| **VA Edge Fade** (inversion + swing + 4R) | 1st touch | $1,453 | 30.1% | 1.30 | 13.3 |

**Key insight:** The 80P Rule remains the higher edge per trade (PF 2.57-3.45 vs 1.30-1.63) but fires fewer times. The VA Edge Fade generates 2-5x more opportunities. The two strategies are **complementary** — different setups, can run simultaneously.

## Recommendations

1. **Primary VA Edge Fade setup:** Limit entry at VA edge on 2nd test + 2 ATR stop + POC target → $1,309/mo, PF 1.63
2. **Scalp overlay:** 2x5min + 2 ATR + 0.2 ATR trail on ALL pokes → $913/mo at 63% WR — run as secondary income
3. **SHORT bias confirmed:** For first-touch trades, SHORT (VAH) fades produce 70% WR vs ~63% for LONG (VAL)
4. **Avoid 0.5 ATR trail** — universally fails, dead zone between scalp and trend
5. **2 ATR stop is optimal** — 80pt is too wide for most setups (median sweep is only 12pt)
6. **Stack with 80P Rule** — different triggers, same VA framework, both strategies can fire on the same day
