## 1. Portfolio Components

| Strategy | Trades | T/Mo | WR | PF | $/Mo | Avg Risk |
|----------|--------|------|-----|-----|------|----------|
| 80P 100% Retest + 2R | 26 | 2.2 | 96.2% | 3,351 | $1,408 | 65p |
| VA Edge Fade Limit Edge + Swing + 1R | 120 | 10.2 | 70.0% | 2.25 | $813 | 21p |
| **COMBINED** | **146** | **12.4** | **74.7%** | **4.40** | **$2,222** | **29p** |

**Note:** The 80P Retest shows 96.2% WR / PF 3,351 because it uses a limit order at 100% retest of the extension high/low — these entries are extremely selective (26 trades in 12 months). The single "loss" was $-5 (essentially breakeven).

## 2. Actual Drawdown (5 MNQ Contracts)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Max Drawdown** | **$-1,279** |
| Peak equity | $20,848 (trade #104) |
| Trough | $19,568 (trade #117) |
| Recovery | 3 trades to recover |
| Max consecutive losses | 3 trades ($-250) |

### Top 5 Drawdown Periods

| Depth | Length | Start | End |
|-------|--------|-------|-----|
| $-1,279 | 15 trades | #105 | #120 |
| $-625 | 5 trades | #133 | #138 |
| $-410 | 1 trade | #26 | #27 |
| $-395 | 3 trades | #139 | #142 |
| $-337 | 2 trades | #70 | #72 |

**Key insight:** The max drawdown on the actual trade series is only $1,279 on 5 contracts. That's remarkably shallow for $2,222/mo in income.

### Conservative (99% confidence) — Start here
```
Contracts:  12 MNQ
Monthly:    $5,252
Annual:     $63,020
99% DD:     $4,403 (within $4,500 limit)
```

### Recommended (95% confidence)
```
Contracts:  15 MNQ
Monthly:    $6,565
Annual:     $78,775

```

### Scale-Up Protocol
```
1. Start with 12 MNQ contracts
2. After building $1,500 buffer above trailing DD → scale to 15 MNQ
3. After building $2,500 buffer → scale to 17 MNQ
4. After any losing week → drop back to 12 MNQ for 3 days
```

## 6. Consistency Rule Check (35-40%)

Most prop firms require no single day exceeds 35-40% of total profit.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Best single day | $4,120 (12.6% of total profit) |
| Days exceeding 35% | **0** |
| Actual winning days | 79 |
| Min needed for 35% rule | 3 |
| **Result** | **PASS** |

## 8. Answer: Can You Use a $150K / $4,500 DD Prop Account?

**YES — emphatically.**

This portfolio is ideally suited for a $150K prop account with $4,500 trailing drawdown:

1. **At 5 MNQ (baseline):** $2,222/mo income, max DD only $1,835 at 99th percentile. 0% probability of breach. Uses less than 41% of your DD budget.

2. **At 12 MNQ (conservative start):** $5,252/mo income, 99% DD stays within $4,500. Only 0.7% chance of breach.

3. **At 15 MNQ (recommended target):** $6,565/mo income, 95% DD is $4,347 — tight to the $4,500 limit but manageable with the scale-up protocol.

4. **Consistency rules:** No single day exceeds 12.6% of total profit. Easily passes the 35-40% rule.

5. **Monthly consistency:** 92% profitable months. Only 1 losing month ($-387) in 13 months.

**The portfolio's strength is its defensive profile:** 74.7% combined win rate, max 3 consecutive losses, and the 80P Retest component (96.2% WR) acts as an anchor that prevents extended drawdowns.
