# 80% Rule (80P) Strategy Report

**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Data:** 259 RTH sessions (Feb 20, 2025 - Feb 20, 2026) — NQ/MNQ 1-min volumetric bars
**Method:** Replay-based optimization across 160 configurations

---

## 1. Strategy Overview

The 80% Rule (Dalton, *Markets in Profile*) is a mean-reversion setup triggered when price opens outside the prior session's Value Area and fails to sustain the breakout:

1. **Setup condition:** RTH open prints outside prior session's Value Area (VAH or VAL)
2. **Entry trigger:** Price re-enters VA and is "accepted" — 1 consecutive 30-min close inside VA
3. **Direction:** LONG when open < VAL (gap down fails); SHORT when open > VAH (gap up fails)
4. **Target:** Opposite VA boundary (full traverse)
5. **Stop:** Beyond the VA boundary that was breached + 10pt buffer

### Relationship to Gap Fills

The 80P is fundamentally a **gap fill strategy with an acceptance confirmation filter**. Analysis of 259 sessions confirms:

- 100% of accepted 80P setups had the RTH gap fill during the session
- 0 accepted setups occurred without a gap fill
- 78% of accepted setups achieved full VA traverse
- The acceptance filter eliminates fake gap fills (wick-and-reverse patterns)

## 2. Value Area Computation

VA is calculated using the **CBOT standard POC expansion method**:
1. Build volume profile by distributing each bar's volume across all price bins from bar low to bar high
2. Find POC (price bin with maximum volume)
3. Expand contiguously outward from POC, adding the higher-volume side at each step
4. Stop when 70% of total session volume is captured
5. The resulting contiguous range = Value Area (VAL to VAH)

### VA Source Comparison (259 sessions)

| VA Source | Mean Width | Median | Min | Max |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-----|-----|
| RTH 1-day | 167 pts | 126 pts | 10 pts | 1,669 pts |
| **ETH 1-day** | **199 pts** | **158 pts** | **24 pts** | **1,996 pts** |
| RTH 3-day composite | 323 pts | 266 pts | 65 pts | 1,688 pts |
| RTH 5-day composite | 433 pts | 371 pts | 127 pts | 1,688 pts |

**ETH (overnight + RTH) 1-day VA is the best source** — it captures overnight institutional positioning and produces the highest-performing configurations.

## 5. Key Findings

### 5.1 ETH VA Outperforms RTH VA
ETH (overnight + RTH) VA captures overnight institutional positioning. The "open outside VA" condition is more meaningful against ETH VA because it accounts for overnight price discovery.

### 5.2 Single-Period Acceptance (acc=1) Beats Double (acc=2)
With 259 sessions, faster entry (1 x 30-min close inside VA) produces more trades and better total returns than the stricter 2-period requirement. The stricter filter improves WR slightly but loses too many setups.

### 5.3 High R Targets Are Optimal
The best configurations use 3R-4R targets with ~37-40% WR. The few big winners (especially during volatility events like April 2025 tariff crash: +$4,514 and +$5,954 trades) more than compensate for frequent small stops.

### 5.4 BOTH Directions Outperform LONG-Only at High R
SHORT trades capture crash/correction events that produce outsized winners. At conservative R targets (1R, 1.5R), LONG-only is safer. At 3R+ targets, including shorts is essential for capturing tail events.

### 5.5 Composite VA (3-day, 5-day) Underperforms
Wider composite VAs produce larger stops, worse R:R, and lower WR. Single-session VA (RTH or ETH) is optimal.

## 6. MFE / MAE Analysis (Best Config: eth_1d, acc=1, 60 trades)

### Maximum Favorable Excursion (how far winners ran)
| Percentile | MFE |
|-----------|------|
| 25th | 8 pts |
| 50th | 28 pts |
| 75th | 78 pts |
| 90th | 153 pts |
| Mean | 66 pts |

### Maximum Adverse Excursion (how far losers went against)
| Percentile | MAE |
|-----------|------|
| 25th | 16 pts |
| 50th | 30 pts |
| 75th | 58 pts |
| 90th | 74 pts |
| Mean | 38 pts |

### MFE in R-Multiples
| Percentile | MFE (R) |
|-----------|---------|
| 25th | 0.2R |
| 50th | 0.5R |
| 75th | 1.5R |
| 90th | 3.4R |
| Mean | 1.3R |

**Implication:** Median trade only reaches 0.5R favorable — over half the trades never reach even 1R. But the top 25% reach 1.5R+ and the top 10% reach 3.4R+. This is why high-R targets work: you accept frequent small losses to capture the fat-tail winners.

## 10. Risk Profile

### Best Config (eth_1d | acc1 | BOTH | 4R)
- **Average risk per trade:** 59 pts (~$590 at 5 MNQ)
- **Average winner:** $1,237
- **Average loser:** -$411
- **Win rate:** 36.7% (22 wins / 38 losses out of 60 trades)
- **Profit factor:** 1.74
- **Expectancy:** $164/trade

### Per-Account Projection (5 MNQ contracts, $800 risk)
- **Monthly trades:** 5.1
- **Monthly P&L:** ~$986
- **Annual P&L:** ~$11,832
- **5 accounts:** ~$4,930/month, ~$59,160/year

## 11. Comparison: 3-Month vs 1-Year Results

| Metric | 3 Months (62 sessions) | 1 Year (259 sessions) |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Best WR | 100% (eth_1d, acc2, LONG) | 66.7% (rth_1d, acc2, LONG, poc) |
| Best $/mo | $838 (5 trades) | $986 (60 trades) |
| Best PF | inf (no losers) | 1.74 |
| Optimal direction | LONG only | BOTH (at high R) |
| Optimal acceptance | acc=2 | acc=1 |
| Optimal R target | opposite_va | 4R |

**Critical lesson:** 3 months of data produced dangerously misleading "100% WR" results. With 1 year, the true edge is a low-WR, high-R:R profile where tail-event winners drive profitability.

## 12. Implementation Notes

### Strategy Parameters (Recommended Production Config)
```
VA Source:        ETH 1-day (full session including overnight)
Acceptance:       1 x 30-min close inside VA (acc=1)
Directions:       BOTH (LONG + SHORT)
Target:           4R (4x risk distance from entry)
Stop:             VA boundary + 10pt buffer
Entry cutoff:     13:00 ET (no new entries after)
Exit cutoff:      15:30 ET (force close)
Min VA width:     25 pts
```

### Engine Considerations
- 80P trades are **exempt from PM VWAP breach exits** — the strategy is mean-reversion, not trend-following, so VWAP alignment is irrelevant
- Stop and target levels handle all exits (plus EOD force-close)
- The strategy should track VA acceptance state across 30-min TPO periods starting from IB end (10:30 ET)

---

## 13. Conclusion

The 80P Rule is a **viable standalone strategy** producing ~$986/month per account with the optimal configuration. Its edge comes from:

1. **Structural mean-reversion** — failed VA breakouts revert at statistically significant rates
2. **Acceptance filter** — eliminates fake gap fills and wick reversals
3. **Fat-tail capture** — high R targets (4R) harvest outsized moves during volatility events
4. **Frequency** — 5.1 trades/month provides enough volume for meaningful income

The strategy is **not** the 80% WR / 1:4 R:R setup originally hypothesized. Real-world performance is closer to **37% WR / 3:1 R:R** — a classic trend-following P&L distribution applied to a mean-reversion entry signal.
