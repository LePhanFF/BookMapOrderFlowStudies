# 20P Rule v2 — Structure-Based Stops

**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Data:** 259 RTH sessions (Feb 20, 2025 — Feb 20, 2026) — NQ/MNQ 1-min volumetric bars
**Method:** Replay-based backtest, same entry as v1 but with structure-based stops

---

## 1. Why v2?

v1 used the IB boundary as the stop for every 20P trade — median 183 pts risk. That's what a mechanical backtest does. No human trader would put their stop on the other side of the IB range for an IBH breakout. A real trader places the stop against the **structure that confirms the entry**: the swing point, the FVG, a reactionary level.

v2 tests what happens when you trade like a human — tight stops against structure, size to the stop, cap risk at 2 ATR max.

## 2. Stop Distance Comparison

| Stop Type | N | Mean | Median | 25th | 75th | vs IB boundary |
|-----------|---|------|--------|------|------|----------------|
| **Swing 3-bar** | 44 | 41p | **32p** | 20p | 61p | **17.6%** |
| Swing 5-bar | 44 | 75p | 60p | 33p | 99p | 32.7% |
| 15m FVG | 0 | — | — | — | — | no data |
| 1m FVG | 13 | 12p | 12p | 8p | 14p | 6.5% |
| **1x ATR** | 44 | 16p | **13p** | 10p | 20p | **7.3%** |
| **2x ATR** | 44 | 32p | **27p** | 19p | 41p | **14.6%** |
| VWAP | 44 | 133p | 113p | 78p | 187p | 61.5% |
| POC | 44 | 365p | 307p | 197p | 472p | 167.4% |
| VA boundary | 44 | 267p | 242p | 131p | 343p | 132.3% |
| IB boundary (v1) | 44 | 209p | 183p | 145p | 283p | 100.0% |

**Key insight:** Structure-based stops are 5-6x tighter than the IB boundary. A 3-bar swing stop is 32p median vs 183p. That changes the math completely.

**15m FVG returned no data** — the FVG columns aren't populated at entry time for these setups. This likely means no active 15-min bull/bear FVG exists at the moment of IB extension. 1-min FVGs exist but are too sparse (13 trades) and too tight (12p = noise territory).

Entry: 3x5min IB extension acceptance (same as v1 best entry)

### 2x ATR Stop (the winner)

| Target | N | T/Mo | WR | PF | $/Mo | Avg Risk | R:R | S/T/E |
|--------|---|------|-----|-----|------|----------|-----|-------|
| **2R** | **44** | **3.7** | **45.5%** | **1.78** | **$496** | **32p** | **2.0** | **24/20/0** |

| 4R | 44 | 3.7 | 29.5% | 1.18 | $157 | 32p | 4.0 | 31/7/6 |
| 6R | 44 | 3.7 | 27.3% | 0.92 | -$76 | 32p | 6.0 | 32/0/12 |

### 1x ATR Stop (aggressive scalp)

| Target | N | T/Mo | WR | PF | $/Mo | Avg Risk | R:R | S/T/E |
|--------|---|------|-----|-----|------|----------|-----|-------|
| 2R | 44 | 3.7 | 36.4% | 1.07 | $30 | 16p | 2.0 | 28/16/0 |
| 3R | 44 | 3.7 | 31.8% | 1.42 | $175 | 16p | 3.0 | 30/14/0 |
| **4R** | **44** | **3.7** | **29.5%** | **1.71** | **$305** | **16p** | **4.0** | **31/13/0** |
| 6R | 44 | 3.7 | 13.6% | 0.66 | -$190 | 16p | 6.0 | 38/6/0 |

### Swing 3-bar Stop

| Target | N | T/Mo | WR | PF | $/Mo | Avg Risk | R:R | S/T/E |
|--------|---|------|-----|-----|------|----------|-----|-------|
| **2R** | **44** | **3.7** | **43.2%** | **1.10** | **$86** | **41p** | **2.0** | **24/16/4** |
| 3R | 44 | 3.7 | 34.1% | 0.99 | -$12 | 41p | 3.0 | 28/9/7 |
| 4R | 44 | 3.7 | 29.5% | 0.88 | -$121 | 41p | 4.0 | 30/4/10 |

### Swing 3-bar (capped at 2x ATR)

| Target | N | T/Mo | WR | PF | $/Mo | Avg Risk | R:R | S/T/E |
|--------|---|------|-----|-----|------|----------|-----|-------|
| **2R** | **17** | **1.4** | **52.9%** | **1.89** | **$170** | **26p** | **2.0** | **8/9/0** |
| 3R | 17 | 1.4 | 29.4% | 1.23 | $61 | 26p | 3.0 | 12/5/0 |

## 4. Entry Model Comparison (with 2x ATR stop, 2R target)

| Entry | N | T/Mo | WR | PF | $/Mo | Risk |
|-------|---|------|-----|-----|------|------|
| 2x5min | 51 | 4.3 | 37.3% | 1.52 | $416 | 32p |
| **3x5min** | **44** | **3.7** | **45.5%** | **1.78** | **$496** | **32p** |
| 1x15min | 51 | 4.3 | 35.3% | 1.37 | $306 | 32p |
| 1x30min | 48 | 4.1 | 27.1% | 0.70 | -$258 | 28p |

3x5min remains the optimal patience level — same conclusion as v1 but with much better PF.

---

## 5. LONG vs SHORT Breakdown (Best Config: 2x ATR + 2R)

| Direction | Trades | WR | PF | $/Mo |
|-----------|--------|-----|-----|------|
| LONG | 31 | 45.2% | 1.98 | $317 |
| SHORT | 13 | 46.2% | 1.58 | $180 |
| **ALL** | **44** | **45.5%** | **1.78** | **$496** |

Interesting shift from v1: with tight stops, LONG outperforms SHORT (PF 1.98 vs 1.58). In v1 with wide stops, SHORT was better because the bigger extensions ran further. With tight stops, direction matters less — R:R dominance takes over.

---

## 6. v1 vs v2 vs 80P Comparison

| Strategy | N | T/Mo | WR | PF | $/Mo | Risk | R:R |
|----------|---|------|-----|-----|------|------|-----|
| **v1**: 3x5min + IB boundary + 1x_ib | 44 | 3.7 | 63.6% | 1.25 | $395 | 219p | 0.6 |
| **v2**: 3x5min + 2x ATR + 2R | 44 | 3.7 | 45.5% | 1.78 | $496 | 32p | 2.0 |
| **v2**: 3x5min + 1x ATR + 4R | 44 | 3.7 | 29.5% | 1.71 | $305 | 16p | 4.0 |
| 80P Baseline (1x30min + 4R) | 60 | 5.1 | 38.3% | 1.70 | $955 | 60p | — |
| **80P Best (Limit 50% VA + 4R)** | **47** | **4.0** | **44.7%** | **2.57** | **$1,922** | **60p** | **—** |

### What changed v1 → v2:

- **WR dropped**: 63.6% → 45.5% (tighter stop = more stops hit)
- **PF jumped**: 1.25 → 1.78 (when you win at 2R, winners are real)
- **Risk collapsed**: 219p → 32p (85% reduction)
- **S/T/E flipped**: v1 had 6/11/27 (mostly messy EOD exits). v2 has 24/20/0 (clean stops or clean targets, zero EOD exits)
- **$/Mo improved**: $395 → $496 (+25%)

### vs 80P:

The 20P v2 at PF 1.78 is now in the **same tier** as the 80P baseline (PF 1.70). It's no longer an embarrassingly thin edge. But 80P best (PF 2.57, $1,922/mo) is still 4x more profitable.

---

## 7. The Real Comparison: Risk-Adjusted

The 20P v2 risks 32 pts per trade. The 80P risks ~60 pts. Per dollar of risk:

| Strategy | Risk/Trade | Reward/Win | PF | Edge per $1 risked |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----|---------------------|
| 20P v2 (2x ATR, 2R) | 32p ($320) | 64p ($640) | 1.78 | $0.78 |
| 80P Best (4R) | 60p ($600) | 240p ($2,400) | 2.57 | $1.57 |

80P still has 2x better edge per dollar risked. The 20P v2 is a legitimate trade, but the 80P remains structurally superior because of Dalton's insight: entering inside the Value Area gives you a natural, defined edge with the balance point working in your favor.

## 8. Two Viable 20P Configurations

### Config A: "The ATR Box" (recommended)
```
Entry:     3x5min IB extension acceptance
Stop:      2x ATR below entry (LONG) / above entry (SHORT)
Target:    2R (2x the stop distance)
Risk:      ~32 pts median ($320 per MNQ contract)
WR:        45.5%
PF:        1.78
Frequency: 3.7 trades/month
$/Mo:      $496 (5 contracts)
```

### Config B: "The Scalp Sniper"
```
Entry:     3x5min IB extension acceptance
Stop:      1x ATR below entry (LONG) / above entry (SHORT)
Target:    4R (4x the stop distance)
Risk:      ~16 pts median ($160 per MNQ contract)
WR:        29.5%
PF:        1.71
Frequency: 3.7 trades/month
$/Mo:      $305 (5 contracts)
```

Config A is better for most traders: higher WR (45% vs 29%), similar PF, more $/month. Config B is for those who can stomach losing 70% of trades in exchange for massive R:R when it works.

## 9. What the Swing Point Data Tells Us

The swing 3-bar stop alone was underwhelming (PF 1.10 at 2R, $86/mo). But when capped at 2x ATR, it jumped to PF 1.89 — the highest PF in the study, just with low frequency (17 trades, 1.4/mo).

This suggests: **the best trades are when structure and ATR agree**. When the nearest swing point is within 2 ATR of entry, you have a clean stop that's both structurally meaningful and risk-appropriate. When the swing is too far away (>2 ATR), skip the trade.

---

## 10. Conclusions

### What We Learned

1. **Structure-based stops make the 20P viable.** PF improved from 1.25 → 1.78. The trade is now legitimate.

2. **2x ATR is the optimal stop distance** — 32p median risk, balances getting stopped by noise vs giving the trade room.

3. **1x ATR works for 4R scalps** — 16p risk, PF 1.71, but only 29.5% WR. Not for everyone.

4. **WR drops with tighter stops (45% vs 64%)** but that's the correct tradeoff. Better to have a clean 2R winner than a messy EOD exit.

5. **Zero EOD exits in v2** — S/T/E is 24/20/0. Every trade has a clean resolution (stopped or target hit). v1 was 6/11/27 with most trades drifting to EOD.

6. **80P is still king** — $1,922/mo PF 2.57 vs $496/mo PF 1.78. But the 20P is no longer a throwaway. It's additive.

7. **15-min FVGs don't exist at entry** — no data at all. The breakout area lacks active 15m FVG zones.

8. **Swing + ATR cap = highest PF (1.89)** but too few trades (17). Worth watching for confluence.

### Recommendation

**Trade the 20P as a secondary setup alongside the 80P:**

1. Open outside VA → wait for IB to form
2. If price re-enters VA → trade the 80P (primary, $1,922/mo)
3. If IB extends away from VA (3x5min closes beyond IB):
   - Place stop at 2x ATR from entry
   - Target 2R
   - Size to risk 1-2% of account
   - Expected: ~$496/mo additive on 5 MNQ contracts

**Combined system potential**: $1,922 + $496 = ~$2,400/mo, with the 20P adding value on days the 80P doesn't fire.
