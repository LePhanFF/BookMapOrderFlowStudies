# 20P Rule Study — Trend Extension (The Failure of 80P)

**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Data:** 259 RTH sessions (Feb 20, 2025 — Feb 20, 2026) — NQ/MNQ 1-min volumetric bars
**Method:** Replay-based backtest of 6 entry models across multiple target/stop combinations

---

## 1. What is the 20P Rule?

The **80P Rule** (Dalton) trades the return-to-balance: price opens outside prior VA, re-enters VA, rotates back through. It fires ~38% of the time with acceptance, and our best config produces $1,922/mo.

The **20P Rule** is the inverse — the 20% of the time the breakout is **real**:
- Price opens outside prior session's Value Area
- Instead of rotating back into VA, it **extends further away**
- IB extension confirms the trend (accept above IBH / below IBL)
- We catch the extension move

**Direction logic (opposite of 80P):**
- Open ABOVE VAH → price continues UP → **LONG** (with IBH extension)
- Open BELOW VAL → price continues DOWN → **SHORT** (with IBL extension)

## 2. Setup Frequency (259 sessions)

| Stage | Count | % of Sessions | Per Month |
|-------|-------|---------------|-----------|
| Total sessions | 259 | 100% | 22.0 |
| Open outside prior VA | 160 | 62% | 13.6 |
| — LONG (open > VAH) | 92 | 36% | 7.8 |
| — SHORT (open < VAL) | 68 | 26% | 5.8 |
| IB extends in trend direction | 78 | 30% | 6.6 |
| Price re-enters VA (80P fires) | 92 | 57% of setups | 7.8 |
| **Pure 20P (never re-enters VA)** | **68** | **42% of setups** | **5.8** |

**Key finding:** 42% of open-outside-VA sessions never re-enter the VA at all. The breakout holds. But only 49% see IB extension in the trend direction — the rest stay rangebound.

---

## 3. Session Characteristics

### Gap Distance (open to VA boundary)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Mean | 131 pts |
| Median | 81 pts |
| 25th pctl | 30 pts |
| 75th pctl | 184 pts |

### IB Range (these sessions)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Mean | 195 pts |
| Median | 168 pts |

### Extension Depth (when IB extends)

| Metric | From IB | As Multiple of IB Range |
|--------|---------|------------------------|
| 25th pctl | 28 pts | 0.18x |
| **Median** | **67 pts** | **0.51x** |
| 75th pctl | 124 pts | 0.90x |
| 90th pctl | 209 pts | 1.25x |

### By Direction

| Direction | Setups | IB Extended | Pure 20P | Median Extension |
|-----------|--------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| LONG | 92 | 46 (50%) | 40 (43%) | 60 pts |
| SHORT | 68 | 32 (47%) | 28 (41%) | 112 pts |

**SHORT extensions run nearly 2x further than LONG** (median 112 pts vs 60 pts). This makes sense — panic selling is sharper than gradual buying.

---

## 4. Extension Target Reachability

What percentage of IB-extending sessions actually reach each target level?

| Target Level | Sessions Reaching | % |
|-------------|------------------|---|
| 0.5x IB range | 41/78 | **53%** |
| 1.0x IB range | 15/78 | **19%** |
| 1.5x IB range | 5/78 | 6% |
| 2.0x IB range | 2/78 | 3% |
| 2.5x IB range | 0/78 | 0% |

**This is the core problem with the 20P.** Most extensions are shallow. Only 19% reach 1x IB range from the IB boundary. Targets beyond 1x IB range are unrealistic.

---

## 5. Entry Model Results

### Model A: IB Extension Acceptance (2x 5-min closes beyond IB)

Best target = 1x IB range:

| Acceptance | N | Trd/Mo | WR | PF | $/Mo |
|-----------|---|--------|-----|-----|------|
| 1x5min | 55 | 4.7 | 56.4% | 0.94 | -$144 |
| 2x5min | 51 | 4.3 | 58.8% | 1.03 | $75 |
| **3x5min** | **44** | **3.7** | **63.6%** | **1.23** | **$379** |
| 1x15min | 51 | 4.3 | 58.8% | 1.08 | $157 |
| 1x30min | 48 | 4.1 | 62.5% | 1.21 | $348 |

More patience (3x5min or 1x30min) improves WR to 63% but $/mo stays modest.

### Model B: VA Boundary Rejection (bounce off VA edge)

| Config | N | WR | PF | $/Mo |
|--------|---|-----|-----|------|
| wick>=3pt, 1x_ib target | 60 | 11.7% | 0.94 | -$47 |
| wick>=5pt, 4R target | 58 | 15.5% | 0.94 | -$48 |
| wick>=10pt, 4R target | 55 | 18.2% | 0.98 | -$15 |

**VA boundary rejection is a disaster.** 11–18% WR. The stop is too tight (inside VA) and price doesn't cleanly bounce off the VA edge to continue trending.

### Model C: Pullback After IB Extension

| Entry Type | N | WR | PF | $/Mo |
|-----------|---|-----|-----|------|
| Immediate | 51 | 58.8% | 1.03 | $75 |
| 25% pullback | 49 | 59.2% | 1.15 | $310 |
| 50% pullback | 44 | 59.1% | 1.07 | $134 |
| 75% pullback | 42 | 57.1% | 1.15 | $284 |
| 100% pullback (IB boundary) | 40 | 57.5% | 1.13 | $235 |

Shallow pullback (25%) marginally improves results, but the edge is thin.

### Model D: Time-Based Confirmation (N bars staying outside VA)

| Bars Outside VA | N | WR | PF | $/Mo |
|----------------|---|-----|-----|------|
| 2x5min | 128 | 36.7% | 0.65 | -$2,192 |
| 3x5min | 124 | 40.3% | 0.69 | -$1,853 |
| 4x5min | 119 | 40.3% | 0.61 | -$2,276 |
| 5x5min | 120 | 40.8% | 0.59 | -$2,360 |

**Simply staying outside VA is not a usable signal.** WR is ~37-41% and all configs are deeply negative.

### Model E: Order Flow Filters (on 2x5min IB extension)

| Filter | N | WR | PF | $/Mo |
|--------|---|-----|-----|------|
| No filter | 51 | 58.8% | 1.03 | $75 |
| Delta aligns | 27 | 48.1% | 0.47 | -$846 |
| **Delta pctl>60** | **22** | **63.6%** | **1.32** | **$244** |
| **Delta pctl>75** | **11** | **63.6%** | **1.67** | **$250** |

Delta percentile > 60 at the extension bar improves WR to 63.6% and PF to 1.32, but reduces sample to 22 trades. Delta pctl>75 has the highest PF (1.67) but only 11 trades — too few to be reliable.

Surprisingly, simple "delta aligns with direction" is **negative** — it's too loose a filter.

## 6. Top Configurations Ranked by $/Month

| Rank | Configuration | N | Trd/Mo | WR | PF | $/Mo |
|------|--------------|---|--------|-----|-----|------|
| 1 | **3x5min IB ext + IB+20pt + 1x_ib** | 44 | 3.7 | 63.6% | 1.25 | **$395** |
| 2 | 3x5min IB ext + IB+10pt + 1x_ib | 44 | 3.7 | 63.6% | 1.23 | $379 |
| 3 | 1x30min IB ext + IB+20pt + 1x_ib | 48 | 4.1 | 62.5% | 1.23 | $373 |
| 4 | 1x30min IB ext + IB+10pt + 1x_ib | 48 | 4.1 | 62.5% | 1.21 | $348 |
| 5 | 3x5min IB ext + IB+20pt + va_width | 44 | 3.7 | 61.4% | 1.22 | $330 |
| 6 | 25% pullback + IB+20pt + 1x_ib | 49 | 4.2 | 59.2% | 1.15 | $318 |
| 7 | 25% pullback + IB+10pt + 1x_ib | 49 | 4.2 | 59.2% | 1.15 | $310 |
| 8 | Delta pctl>75 + 2x5min + 1x_ib | 11 | 0.9 | 63.6% | 1.67 | $250 |
| 9 | Delta pctl>60 + 2x5min + 1x_ib | 22 | 1.9 | 63.6% | 1.32 | $244 |

---

## 7. LONG vs SHORT Breakdown (Best Config)

**3x5min IB extension + 1x IB range target:**

| Direction | Trades | WR | PF | $/Mo |
|-----------|--------|-----|-----|------|
| LONG | 31 | 61.3% | 1.15 | $143 |
| **SHORT** | **13** | **69.2%** | **1.46** | **$287** |

SHORT is more profitable per trade despite fewer opportunities. SHORT extensions run further (median 112 pts vs 60 pts), and when the 20P fires downside, it tends to be a conviction move.

---

## 8. Comparison to 80P

| Strategy | N | Trd/Mo | WR | PF | $/Mo |
|----------|---|--------|-----|-----|------|
| **80P** Baseline (1x30min + 4R) | 60 | 5.1 | 38.3% | 1.70 | **$955** |
| **80P** Best (Limit 50% + 4R) | 47 | 4.0 | 44.7% | 2.57 | **$1,922** |
| **80P** Double Top (100% retest + 2R) | 35 | 3.0 | 65.7% | 3.45 | **$915** |
| **20P** Best (3x5min + 1x_ib) | 44 | 3.7 | 63.6% | 1.25 | **$395** |
| **20P** + Delta pctl>75 | 11 | 0.9 | 63.6% | 1.67 | **$250** |

**The 80P is 2.4–4.9x more profitable than the 20P.** The 20P has decent WR (63%) but thin edge (PF 1.23–1.25). The 80P has better expectancy per trade because the risk/reward is favorable — entering the VA gives a defined target with manageable risk.

---

## 9. Why the 20P Underperforms

### Problem 1: Shallow Extensions
Median extension from IB is only 67 pts (0.51x IB range). Most 20P sessions extend modestly, not dramatically. Only 19% reach 1x IB range — the first realistic target.

### Problem 2: Large Risk Per Trade
Stop at IB boundary = ~200 pts average risk. The 80P's risk is ~60 pts (VA edge + buffer). The 20P needs a 200-pt move just to hit 1R, while the 80P needs 60 pts.

### Problem 3: Entry is Late
By the time IB extension is confirmed (3x5min = 15 minutes of closes beyond IB), much of the move has already happened. The entry is late in the extension.

### Problem 4: Winners are Mostly EOD Exits
The S/T/E breakdown shows: 6 stopped / 11 target / 27 EOD for the best config. Most "winners" are positions that drift favorably and get closed at 15:30. These are messy partial wins, not clean target hits.

### Problem 5: No Clean Risk Definition
The 80P has a beautiful risk definition: entry inside VA, stop at VA edge. The 20P lacks this — you're entering beyond IB with the stop far behind at the IB boundary, and the target is an arbitrary projection with low hit rates.

---

## 10. Can 20P + 80P Be Combined?

The 20P and 80P are mutually exclusive outcomes of the same setup (open outside VA):
- **57% of sessions** → price re-enters VA → 80P fires
- **42% of sessions** → price never re-enters VA → 20P territory

A combined system could:
1. Wait for the open-outside-VA setup
2. If price re-enters VA → trade the 80P (return to balance)
3. If price extends away after IB → trade the 20P (trend continuation)

But the numbers don't support aggressive 20P trading. Even the best 20P config only adds $395/mo with thin PF 1.25. The risk of dragging down a $1,922/mo 80P system isn't worth the marginal gain.

**Better approach:** Use the 20P knowledge *defensively* — when the IB extends in the direction of the gap (3+ 5-min closes beyond IB), that's a signal to **NOT take the 80P** (the reversion is less likely to succeed). This could filter out some 80P losers rather than generating 20P trades.

---

## 11. Conclusions

### What We Learned

1. **The 20P is a real phenomenon** — 42% of open-outside-VA sessions never re-enter the VA. The breakout holds.

2. **Extensions are shallow** — median only 0.51x IB range from the IB boundary. Only 19% reach 1x IB range.

3. **Best entry: 3x5min IB extension acceptance** — 63.6% WR, PF 1.25, $395/mo. Patience (waiting for 3 consecutive 5-min closes) matters.

4. **VA boundary rejection does NOT work** as a 20P entry — 11–18% WR. Price doesn't cleanly bounce off the VA edge.

5. **Pullback entries are neutral** — neither help nor hurt significantly. The 25% pullback is marginally best.

6. **Order flow (delta pctl>60)** improves quality but decimates sample size. Not enough trades to be reliable.

7. **SHORT 20P outperforms LONG** — 69.2% WR vs 61.3%. SHORT extensions run 2x further (112 pts vs 60 pts median). Panic selling creates better trend continuation than gradual buying.

8. **The 20P is dramatically weaker than the 80P** — $395/mo (PF 1.25) vs $1,922/mo (PF 2.57). The 80P is the superior play by every metric.

9. **The 20P's best use is as a defensive filter for the 80P** — when IB extends away from VA, avoid taking the 80P return-to-balance trade.

### Implementation Parameters (Best Config)

```
Setup:          Open outside prior ETH 1-day VA
Direction:      LONG if open > VAH, SHORT if open < VAL
Entry trigger:  3 consecutive 5-min closes beyond IB boundary
                (above IBH for LONG, below IBL for SHORT)
Stop:           IB boundary + 20pt buffer
                (IBL - 20pt for LONG, IBH + 20pt for SHORT)
Target:         1x IB range from IB boundary
                (IBH + IB_range for LONG, IBL - IB_range for SHORT)
Entry cutoff:   13:00 ET
Exit cutoff:    15:30 ET
Min VA width:   25 pts
```

### Recommendation

**Do not trade the 20P standalone.** The edge is too thin (PF 1.25) and the risk is too large (~200 pts per trade). Use the 20P research to:

1. **Filter 80P entries** — if IB extends in the gap direction after open, skip the 80P that day
2. **Combine with the Dalton Playbook** — the 20P sessions are Trend Days (Strategy 1 in the playbook), which already has a defined entry model with better risk/reward
3. **Watch for SHORT 20P only** — the 69% WR / PF 1.46 on shorts is the most promising signal, potentially combinable with the IBH Sweep Short strategy on different day types
