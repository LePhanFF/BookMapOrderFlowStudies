# 80% Rule (80P) Strategy Report — v3

**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Data:** 259 RTH sessions (Feb 20, 2025 - Feb 20, 2026) — NQ/MNQ 1-min volumetric bars
**Method:** Replay-based optimization (160 configs) + forensic loss diagnosis (60 trades) + entry model research (VA depth, ATR stops, rejection candle retest)

---

## 1. Strategy Overview

The 80% Rule (Dalton, *Markets in Profile*) is a **failed-trend / return-to-balance** strategy. When price opens outside the prior session's Value Area and fails to sustain the breakout, it trades the rotation back into balance:

1. **Setup condition:** RTH open prints outside prior session's Value Area (VAH or VAL)
2. **Entry trigger:** Price re-enters VA and is "accepted" — 1 consecutive 30-min close inside VA
3. **Direction:** LONG when open < VAL (gap down fails); SHORT when open > VAH (gap up fails)
4. **Target:** Opposite VA boundary (or R-multiple of risk)
5. **Stop:** Beyond the VA boundary that was breached + buffer
6. **Exit cutoff:** 15:30 ET force close

### Dalton Framework

This is a **failed breakout / return to balance** setup. Price attempts to trend away from the prior session's value, fails, and rotates back through the VA. The acceptance filter confirms the failure — the market is rejecting the breakout and re-establishing value.

### Relationship to Gap Fills

The 80P is fundamentally a **gap fill strategy with an acceptance confirmation filter**:

- 100% of accepted 80P setups had the RTH gap fill during the session
- 78% of accepted setups achieved full VA traverse (session level)
- The acceptance filter eliminates fake gap fills (wick-and-reverse patterns)

## 2. Value Area Computation

VA is calculated using the **CBOT standard POC expansion method** with 70% of total session volume.

### VA Source Comparison (259 sessions)

| VA Source | Mean Width | Median | Min | Max |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-----|-----|
| RTH 1-day | 167 pts | 126 pts | 10 pts | 1,669 pts |
| **ETH 1-day** | **199 pts** | **158 pts** | **24 pts** | **1,996 pts** |
| RTH 3-day composite | 323 pts | 266 pts | 65 pts | 1,688 pts |
| RTH 5-day composite | 433 pts | 371 pts | 127 pts | 1,688 pts |

**ETH (overnight + RTH) 1-day VA is the best source** — it captures overnight institutional positioning and produces the highest-performing configurations.

## 3. Setup Frequency (259 sessions, 11.8 months)

| Metric | Count | Per Month |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Open outside prior VA | 174 (67%) | 14.8 |
| Price touches VA boundary (post-IB) | 80 (50% of outside opens) | 6.8 |
| 1x30min acceptance (acc=1) | 60 (38% of outside opens) | 5.1 |
| Price reaches 25% into VA | 64 (40%) | 5.4 |
| Price reaches 35% into VA | 57 (36%) | 4.8 |
| Price reaches 50% into VA | 47 (29%) | 4.0 |
| Open inside VA (no setup) | 84 (32%) | 7.1 |

| R:R ratio | 4.0 |
| Expectancy | $159/trade |

### Performance Across Exit Modes (same entry model)

| Exit Mode | WR | PF | $/Month | Trades |
|-----------|-----|-----|---------|--------|
| **4R** | **38.3%** | **1.70** | **$955** | 60 |
| 2R | 46.7% | 1.52 | $616 | 60 |
| opposite_va | 45.0% | 1.56 | $642 | 60 |
| 1R | 51.7% | 1.42 | $424 | 60 |

---

## 5. Loss Diagnosis — Why WR is Low Despite High VA Traversal

**The paradox:** 78% of accepted 80P setups traverse the full VA during the session, yet the production config only wins 38% of trades. Forensic replay of all 60 trades reveals the root cause.

### 5.1 The Problem is the Entry Model, Not Stop Tightness

| Metric | LONG Trades | SHORT Trades |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| Mean entry depth (0=VA edge, 1=opposite VA) | 0.32 | 0.32 |
| **Winners** enter at | **0.45** | **0.37** |
| **Losers** enter at | **0.23** | **0.26** |

The 30-min acceptance bar triggers as soon as price barely pokes inside the VA. **Winners enter 45% into the VA; losers enter at 23%.** Deeper entry = more room from stop, closer to target.

### 5.2 Exit Reason Breakdown (4R target)

| Exit Reason | Count | % | WR | Avg P&L | Avg MFE | Avg MAE |
|------------|-------|---|-----|---------|---------|---------|
| TARGET | 8 | 13.3% | 100% | $2,283 | 244p | 33p |
| **STOP** | **33** | **55.0%** | **0%** | **-$434** | **28p** | **50p** |
| EOD | 19 | 31.7% | 78.9% | $385 | 108p | 39p |

55% of trades get stopped out. Only 13% reach the 4R target. But those winners are worth $2,283 average vs -$434 average loss.

### 5.3 Stop-Out Forensics: 80% Were Legitimate Failures

Of the 33 stopped trades:

| Metric | Count | % |
|--------|-------|---|
| Price LATER reached 4R target | 8 | 24% |
| Price NEVER reached 4R target | **25** | **76%** |

**Only 24% of stopped trades were fixable with wider stops.** The other 76% were correctly stopped — the setup genuinely failed. The stop model is sound; the entry model lets bad setups through.

### 5.4 Wider Stops Don't Help

| Stop Buffer | WR | $/Month |
|-------------|-----|---------|
| 10pt (current) | 13.3% | $316 |
| 20pt | 11.7% | $255 |
| 30pt | 8.3% | -$429 |
| 60pt | 1.7% | -$1,203 |

Wider stops destroy P&L because extra risk per trade isn't compensated by enough saved trades.

### 5.5 The VA Traversal Paradox Explained

| MFE Milestone | % of trades reaching it |
|---------------|------------------------|
| >= 0.5R | 65% |
| >= 1.0R | 43% |
| >= 2.0R | 25% |
| >= 4.0R (target) | **13%** |

The VA traverses during the session, but often before entry, after the stop, or in a non-linear path. **Only 13% of trades reach 4R.** The strategy profits because those 13% are worth ~6x the average loss.

### 5.6 Post-Acceptance Behavior: The Coin Flip

What happens in the 30 minutes AFTER the acceptance candle closes:

| Behavior | Count | % |
|----------|-------|---|
| Continues deeper into VA | 27 | **45%** |
| Reverses back out of VA | 27 | **45%** |
| Chops sideways | 6 | **10%** |

**Acceptance is a coin flip.** ~45% of "accepted" trades immediately reverse back out of VA. These are failed mean-reversion setups — the breakout was real, and the VA touch was just a pullback within the trend.

---

## 6. Entry Model Research — VA Depth Limit Orders

### Question: What if we enter deeper into the VA instead of at the edge?

Instead of entering at the acceptance candle close (32% into VA), use a limit order at a fixed VA depth.

### 6.1 VA Depth Entry Results (opposite_va target)

| Entry Mode | N | Trd/Mo | WR | PF | $/Mo | Avg Risk | Entry Depth |
|-----------|---|--------|-----|-----|------|----------|------------|
| Acceptance (current) | 60 | 5.1 | 45.0% | 1.56 | $642 | 59p | 0.32 |
| Limit 25% VA | 64 | 5.4 | 48.4% | 1.33 | $509 | 56p | 0.25 |
| Limit 35% VA | 57 | 4.8 | 54.4% | 1.36 | $533 | 74p | 0.35 |
| **Limit 50% VA** | **47** | **4.0** | **66.0%** | **2.08** | **$860** | **79p** | **0.50** |

### 6.2 VA Depth Entry Results (4R target)

| Entry Mode | N | Trd/Mo | WR | PF | $/Mo | Avg Risk | Entry Depth |
|-----------|---|--------|-----|-----|------|----------|------------|
| Acceptance (current) | 60 | 5.1 | 38.3% | 1.70 | $955 | 59p | 0.32 |
| Limit 25% VA | 64 | 5.4 | 39.1% | 1.48 | $811 | 56p | 0.25 |
| Limit 35% VA | 57 | 4.8 | 42.1% | 1.72 | $1,203 | 74p | 0.35 |
| **Limit 50% VA** | **47** | **4.0** | **44.7%** | **2.57** | **$1,922** | **79p** | **0.50** |

**Key finding:** Limit 50% VA + 4R target = **$1,922/mo** (PF 2.57) — double the current model. Fewer trades but dramatically better per-trade expectancy. The deeper entry gets closer to POC (the balance point), giving more room from stop and better R:R.

---

## 7. ATR-Based Stop Analysis

### Question: Should we use ATR-based stops instead of fixed 10pt buffer?

Prior session 1-min bar ATR: mean 15.3 pts, median 13.2 pts.

### 7.1 Stop Model Comparison (acceptance entry, opposite_va target)

| Stop Model | N | WR | PF | $/Mo | Avg Risk |
|-----------|---|-----|-----|------|----------|
| **VA edge + 10pt (current)** | **60** | **45.0%** | **1.56** | **$642** | **59p** |
| VA edge + 20pt | 60 | 46.7% | 1.34 | $457 | 69p |
| VA edge + 1 ATR | 60 | 43.3% | 1.39 | $495 | 65p |
| VA edge + 1.5 ATR | 60 | 46.7% | 1.28 | $393 | 73p |
| VA edge + 2 ATR | 60 | 46.7% | 1.14 | $213 | 81p |
| Entry - 1 ATR | 60 | 16.7% | 1.12 | $86 | 16p |

### 7.2 ATR Stops + Limit 35% Entry (opposite_va target)

| Stop Model | N | WR | PF | $/Mo | Avg Risk |
|-----------|---|-----|-----|------|----------|
| VA edge + 10pt (current) | 57 | 54.4% | 1.36 | $533 | 74p |
| VA edge + 20pt | 57 | 57.9% | 1.52 | $774 | 84p |
| **VA edge + 1 ATR** | **57** | **57.9%** | **1.57** | **$820** | **79p** |
| VA edge + 1.5 ATR | 57 | 57.9% | 1.49 | $739 | 87p |
| VA edge + 2 ATR | 57 | 57.9% | 1.39 | $637 | 94p |

**Key finding:** 1 ATR is the optimal stop expansion. It marginally helps with improved entries but **entry improvement matters far more than stop model.** The current 10pt buffer is adequate; the problem is entry location, not stop tightness.

---

## 8. Rejection Candle Retest Entry — The Best Entry Model

### Question: What if we wait for price to retest the acceptance candle?

Instead of entering at the acceptance candle close, wait for a pullback/retracement of the 30-min rejection candle:

- **50% retest** = midpoint of candle range
- **61.8% retest** = fibonacci retracement
- **75% retest** = deep retracement
- **100% retest** = double top/bottom (price tests the candle extreme)

For LONG: candle pushes UP into VA, then pulls back DOWN. Limit at `candle_high - retracement% * candle_range`.
For SHORT: candle pushes DOWN into VA, then bounces back UP. Limit at `candle_low + retracement% * candle_range`.

### 8.1 Rejection Candle Statistics (60 setups)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Mean candle range | 102 pts |
| Median candle range | 77 pts |
| 25th percentile | 57 pts |
| 75th percentile | 115 pts |
| 90th percentile | 190 pts |

### 8.2 Retracement Fill Rates

| Retracement Level | Fills | Fill Rate |
|-------------------|-------|-----------|
| 0% (candle close, current) | 60/60 | 100% |
| 50% | 46/60 | 77% |
| 61.8% | 45/60 | 75% |
| 75% | 41/60 | 68% |
| **100% (double top/bottom)** | **35/60** | **58%** |

### 8.3 Why Stop Mode Matters: Candle vs VA Edge

**Critical finding:** The stop placement relative to the retest candle determines whether the strategy works or fails catastrophically.

| Stop Mode | Description | Result |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Candle extreme ± 10pt** | Stop at candle low/high ± buffer | **5-14% WR — catastrophic failure** |
| **VA edge ± 10pt** | Stop at VAL/VAH ± buffer | **58-66% WR — strong performance** |
| Candle ± 1 ATR | Stop at candle extreme ± 1 ATR | 14-48% WR — mediocre |

**Why candle stops fail:** For a retest entry, the candle extreme is INSIDE the VA. When price retests the candle low (for LONG), the stop is barely below that level — inside the natural VA noise zone. VA edge stops give room for price to oscillate through the candle range without triggering the stop.

### 8.5 What the 100% Retest (Double Top/Bottom) Does

The 100% retest = price returns to the candle extreme after acceptance. For a LONG, price pushes into VA, then pulls all the way back to the candle low (a double bottom). For a SHORT, price pushes down into VA, then bounces back to the candle high (a double top).

**Why it works so well:**
1. **Confirms support/resistance** — the candle extreme holds as a floor/ceiling, proving the VA boundary is real support/resistance
2. **Filters out weak setups** — the 45% of trades that reverse after acceptance never pull back to form the double top/bottom; they just keep going
3. **Better entry price** — entering at the candle extreme (near VA edge) with VA edge stop gives a tighter risk and the full VA width as reward
4. **Only 58% fill rate** — you miss 42% of setups, but the ones you catch are the highest quality

## 10. Strategy Comparison — Three Philosophies

The research reveals three distinct strategy personalities:

### A. Maximum $/Month — Limit 50% VA + 4R

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Entry | Limit at 50% VA depth (POC area) |
| Stop | VA edge + 10pt |
| Target | 4R |
| Trades | 47 (4.0/mo) |
| Win rate | 44.7% |
| Profit factor | 2.57 |
| **Monthly P&L** | **$1,922** |

**Profile:** Higher WR than current, much better PF, double the $/mo. Enters at the balance point of the VA — closer to target, further from stop. Relies on ~4R tail-event winners. Downside: requires patience; 29% of outside-VA sessions trigger (vs 38% for acceptance).

### B. Maximum Win Rate — 100% Retest + 2R

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Entry | 100% candle retracement (double top/bottom) |
| Stop | VA edge + 10pt |
| Target | 2R |
| Trades | 35 (3.0/mo) |
| Win rate | **65.7%** |
| Profit factor | **3.45** |
| **Monthly P&L** | **$915** |

**Profile:** Highest WR + PF combination in the study. The double top/bottom confirms the VA boundary is holding. Very clean risk definition. Downside: only 35 trades/year (3/mo), meaning longer drawdown periods between signals.

### C. Maximum Frequency — Current Model (Baseline)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Entry | Acceptance candle close |
| Stop | VA edge + 10pt |
| Target | 4R |
| Trades | 60 (5.1/mo) |
| Win rate | 38.3% |
| Profit factor | 1.70 |
| **Monthly P&L** | **$955** |

**Profile:** Most trades, lowest WR, moderate $/mo. Good for compounding and lower variance in trade count. Downside: psychologically demanding at 38% WR; many small losses before a big winner.

## 14. Conclusion

### What We Learned

1. **The entry model is the primary edge leak** — acceptance triggers at the VA edge (32% in), but winners enter deeper (45%). The acceptance candle is a coin flip (45/45/10 continue/reverse/chop).

2. **Stops are NOT the problem** — 76% of stopped trades were legitimate failures. Wider stops destroy P&L. ATR-based stops marginally improve WR with better entries but don't change the fundamental picture.

3. **Three viable entry models exist**, each with a different risk/reward personality:
   - **Limit 50% VA:** Best $/mo ($1,922), moderate WR (45%), fewest qualifying sessions
   - **100% Retest (double top/bottom):** Best WR (66%) and PF (3.47), moderate $/mo ($881-915), fewest trades
   - **Current acceptance close:** Most trades (5.1/mo), lowest WR (38%), moderate $/mo ($955)

4. **Stop mode matters for retest entries** — candle-based stops fail catastrophically (stop is inside VA). VA edge stops are essential regardless of entry model.

5. **The 80P is a failed-trend / return-to-balance strategy** in Dalton's framework — the attempted breakout fails, and price rotates back through the prior session's value. The deeper the entry into the VA, the more confident we are that the rotation is genuine.

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Implement the limit 50% VA entry** in the backtest engine as a new entry mode — this is the highest-conviction improvement ($1,922/mo vs $955/mo)
2. **Implement the 100% retest entry** as an alternative — best for traders who value high WR and clean risk definition
3. **Add delta confirmation** at entry to filter the coin-flip acceptance bar
4. **Test combining** the 100% retest with the limit 50% VA entry (enter on double top/bottom AND require 50% VA depth)
