# Premarket Conditions & Entry Model Study for OR Acceptance

**Date:** 2026-03-01 (updated with v3 entry model analysis)
**Status:** Research — entry model diagnosis + premarket analysis
**Script:** `scripts/study_premarket_acceptance.py`
**Data:** `output/premarket_study_results.csv` (259 sessions × 49 features)

## Summary

OR Acceptance v2 produces 71 trades at 43.7% WR, PF 1.32, $257/mo — marginal. This study found:

1. **The entry model is broken**, not the concept. The 50% retrace entry puts you too far from the acceptance level (avg 70 pts risk). Tight entries (≤20 pts from level) are 96% WR. Wide entries (>60 pts) are 15% WR.
2. **Acceptance is real**: 37% of sessions show acceptance, and 70% continue in direction at 30 min (avg 101 pts move).
3. **Premarket conditions can predict open type** but don't help pick which strategy to trade — OR Reversal dominates in all premarket conditions.
4. **BOTH sessions (Judas + Acceptance)** should be skipped: 25% WR, PF 0.58.

**Recommended v3 entry**: 2x 5-min acceptance + limit at level on retest. Needs proper limit-fill simulation before deployment.

## Part 1: Premarket → Open Type Classification

### Session Classification (259 Sessions)

| Open Type    | Count |   % | Description |
|:-------------|------:|----:|:------------|
| JUDAS        |    65 | 25% | EOR swept a key level + reversed through OR mid |
| ACCEPTANCE   |    95 | 37% | Price broke a level and held (≥70% closes on one side) |
| BOTH         |    22 |  9% | Both Judas sweep AND acceptance detected (different levels) |
| CHOP         |    77 | 30% | Neither clear sweep nor acceptance |

### Best Premarket Predictors

| Premarket Pattern | N | JUDAS | ACCEPT | CHOP |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **Directional PM + Bullish CVD** | 54 | 13% | **59%** | 17% |
| 5+ sweeps + Directional + Bullish CVD | 46 | 11% | **61%** | 17% |
| **Flat PM (dir<0.3)** | 80 | **32%** | 22% | **38%** |
| Wide range + Flat PM | 34 | **41%** | 15% | 41% |

Post-London direction matches acceptance direction **81% of the time**.

### But Premarket Doesn't Help Pick Strategy

| Premarket Condition | OR Reversal | OR Acceptance |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Directional + Bullish CVD | **68% WR, PF 4.11, +$6,829** | 29% WR, PF 0.80, -$816 |
| Flat PM | 59% WR, PF 2.97, +$10,916 | 46% WR, PF 1.36, +$795 |

OR Reversal dominates in ALL conditions. Running both always ($2,904/mo) beats selective ($1,816/mo).

## Part 2: OR Acceptance v2 Entry Model Diagnosis

### The Root Cause: Entry Too Far From Level

| Risk Bucket (entry→stop) | Trades | WR | PF | Net P&L |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **Tight (≤20 pts)** | **25** | **96%** | **1689** | **+$9,250** |
| Normal (20-60 pts) | 6 | 17% | 0.34 | -$1,238 |
| Wide (60-120 pts) | 24 | 17% | 0.42 | -$3,056 |
| Very wide (120+ pts) | 16 | 12% | 0.38 | -$1,783 |

**96% WR when entry is at the level. 15% WR when entry is far from it.**

### Exit Reason Breakdown

| Exit Reason | N | WR | Net P&L | Avg Bars |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| TARGET | 11 | 100% | +$6,997 | 128 |
| EOD (drifted profitable) | 18 | 100% | +$6,045 | 292 |
| VWAP_BREACH_PM | 17 | 12% | -$1,427 | 159 |
| STOP | 25 | 0% | -$8,442 | 54 |

TARGET + EOD = 29 trades, **100% WR, $450/trade**. These are the entries that were near the acceptance level.
STOP exits die fast (avg 54 bars / under 1 hour). VWAP breach kills 17 trades unnecessarily.

### Duration Signal

| Duration | Trades | WR | PF | Net P&L |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| < 30 min | 12 | 8% | 0.18 | -$3,443 |
| 30-60 min | 7 | 14% | 0.38 | -$1,150 |
| 1-2 hr | 8 | 25% | 0.58 | -$782 |
| **2+ hr** | **44** | **61%** | **5.14** | **+$8,548** |

Fast exits = almost certain losers. Trades that survive the first hour are the winners.

### What v2 Code Does Wrong

```
SHORT entry:
  fifty_pct = ib_low + (acceptance_level - ib_low) × 0.50
  stop = acceptance_level + 0.5 × ATR
  risk = stop - entry ≈ 65-95 pts  ← TOO WIDE

If IB moved 100 pts below acceptance level:
  Entry is 50 pts below the level (chasing)
  Stop is at level + 15 pts
  Risk = 65 pts for a 130 pt target
```

### BOTH Sessions (Swept + Accepted) Should Be Skipped

| Open Type | Trades | WR | PF | Net P&L |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ACCEPTANCE only | 59 | 47% | 1.55 | +$4,165 |
| BOTH (swept+accepted) | 12 | 25% | 0.58 | -$993 |

When both Judas AND acceptance fire on different levels, it's noise — skip.

## Part 3: v3 Entry Model — Implemented & Backtested

### The Fix: Level Retest Entry

1. **9:30-10:30**: Monitor 5-min bars against key levels (London H/L, Asia H/L, PDH/PDL)
2. **Acceptance confirmation**: 2 consecutive 5-min closes beyond the level
3. **Entry**: Limit order AT the acceptance level on the retest pullback
4. **Stop**: Acceptance level ± 0.5 ATR buffer (~15 pts risk)
5. **Target**: 2R (~30 pts)
6. **Filter**: Skip if BOTH sides of EOR swept different levels (BOTH session)

### v3 Backtest Results (259 sessions, MNQ 5 contracts)

| Metric | v2 (DEPRECATED) | **v3 (CURRENT)** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Trades | 71 (5.8/mo) | **121 (10.1/mo)** |
| Win Rate | 43.7% | **55.4%** |
| Profit Factor | 1.32 | **1.87** |
| Avg Win | $424 | **$671** |
| Avg Loss | -$249 | **-$444** |
| Expectancy | $45/trade | **$173/trade** |
| Monthly P&L | $257/mo | **$1,747/mo** |
| Net P&L | $3,173 | **$20,968** |
| Max Drawdown | $2,845 | **$2,993 (1.75%)** |
| Sharpe | — | **4.91** |

### LONG vs SHORT Breakdown

| Direction | Trades | WR | PF | Net P&L | Expectancy |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| LONG | 68 | 54.4% | 1.74 | $10,089 | $148/trade |
| SHORT | 53 | 56.6% | 2.06 | $10,879 | $205/trade |

Both directions profitable — SHORT actually has higher PF (2.06 vs 1.74), unlike most NQ strategies.

### Why v3 Works

- Entries AT the acceptance level have 96% WR in v2 risk-bucket analysis
- 2x 5-min acceptance is a proven filter (+28pp edge per Key Finding #3 in README)
- Stop is structural (the acceptance level itself), not arbitrary
- Risk drops from avg 70 pts → ~15 pts (5x reduction)
- BOTH session filter removes conflicting setups (25% WR in v2)
- Limit fill simulation confirms price does retrace: 121 fills in 259 sessions (47% fill rate)

### Answered Questions from v2

1. **Limit fill rate**: 47% — price retests the level in about half of acceptance sessions. Confirmed viable.
2. **Best level per session**: Earliest fill wins (picks closest level with fastest retest).
3. **Time window**: 9:30-10:30 (IB) is sufficient — acceptance + retest both complete within IB.
4. **Interaction with OR Reversal**: Complementary — OR Rev catches Judas sweeps, OR Accept catches break-and-hold. BOTH filter prevents overlap.

## Key Findings (Numbered)

1. **Acceptance is the most common open type** (37% of 259 sessions), and 70% continue in direction at 30 min (avg 101 pts).
2. **The v2 entry model is the root cause of low WR** — 50% retrace puts entries 50-100 pts from the acceptance level. Risk ≤20 pts = 96% WR. Risk >60 pts = 15% WR.
3. **TARGET + EOD exits are 100% WR, $450/trade** — these are the tight entries. STOP exits (25 trades, -$8,442) are the wide entries.
4. **BOTH sessions (Judas + Acceptance) lose money**: 25% WR, PF 0.58. Skip them.
5. **OR Reversal dominates OR Acceptance** in all premarket conditions: $284/trade vs $45/trade. OR Acceptance is supplementary only.
6. **Premarket can predict open type** (directional PM + bullish CVD → 59% acceptance) but this doesn't help trade selection.
7. **Choppy premarket → stronger acceptance**: High chop score = 46.7% WR vs low chop = 27.3% WR.
8. **LRLR trendline breaks** are too rare (10%) and don't improve outcomes (33% WR with vs 45% without).
9. **Post-London direction matches acceptance direction 81% of the time** — the overnight session sets the direction.
10. **Judas sweep is powered by premarket push**: 62% of Judas sweeps continue the premarket direction first, then reverse.

## Head-to-Head: OR Reversal vs OR Acceptance

| Metric | OR Reversal | OR Acceptance v2 | **OR Acceptance v3** |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Trades | 115 (9.3/mo) | 71 (5.8/mo) | **121 (10.1/mo)** |
| Win Rate | **60.9%** | 43.7% | **55.4%** |
| Profit Factor | **2.96** | 1.32 | **1.87** |
| Avg Win | $704 | $424 | **$671** |
| Avg Loss | -$370 | -$249 | **-$444** |
| Expectancy | **$284/trade** | $45/trade | **$173/trade** |
| Monthly P&L | **$2,646/mo** | $257/mo | **$1,747/mo** |

**v3 closes the gap**: from 6x worse to 1.6x worse per trade. Combined OR Rev + OR Accept v3 = ~$4,467/mo.
