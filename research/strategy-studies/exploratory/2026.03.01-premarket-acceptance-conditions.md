# Premarket Conditions Study for OR Acceptance

**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Status:** Research — premarket pattern analysis
**Script:** `scripts/study_premarket_acceptance.py`
**Data:** `output/premarket_study_results.csv` (259 sessions × 49 features)

---

## Motivation

OR Acceptance was optimized from 0 → 71 trades (43.7% WR, PF 1.32, $3,173 net). The core question: **when NQ opens with acceptance (no Judas swing), does price just continue running?** And what premarket conditions predict clean acceptance vs Judas swing vs choppy consolidation?

User-observed pattern: premarket sweeps key levels → LRLR trendline break → price gaps without looking back (acceptance).

## Session Classification (259 Sessions)

| Open Type    | Count |   % | Description |
|:-------------|------:|----:|:------------|
| JUDAS        |    65 | 25% | EOR swept a key level + reversed through OR mid |
| ACCEPTANCE   |    95 | 37% | Price broke a level and held (≥70% closes on one side) |
| BOTH         |    22 |  9% | Both Judas sweep AND acceptance detected (different levels) |
| CHOP         |    77 | 30% | Neither clear sweep nor acceptance |

**Key insight:** Acceptance is the most common open type (37%), not Judas (25%). 46% of sessions show some acceptance behavior (ACCEPTANCE + BOTH).

---

## Continuation Analysis: Does Acceptance = Continuation?

For the 117 sessions with acceptance (ACCEPTANCE + BOTH), does price continue in the acceptance direction?

| Metric                    | 30-min   | 60-min   |
|:--------------------------|:---------|:---------|
| Continued in direction    | 82/117 (70%) | 80/117 (68%) |
| Average move (pts)        | 101      | 133      |
| Median move (pts)         | 79       | 95       |

**Yes — 70% of the time, acceptance leads to continuation in the first 30 min.** Average move of 101 pts in 30 min and 133 pts in 60 min is significant for MNQ ($0.50/pt × 5 contracts = $2.50/pt).

## Premarket Features by Open Type

Key differentiating features (ACCEPTANCE vs JUDAS):

| Feature                   | JUDAS | ACCEPT | CHOP | Signal |
|:--------------------------|------:|-------:|-----:|:-------|
| Post-London directional   | 0.39  | **0.53** | 0.37 | Acceptance has stronger directional push post-London |
| Chop range ratio          | 0.43  | **0.36** | 0.41 | Acceptance has LESS overnight chop (tighter range last 60m) |
| CVD direction (last 60m)  | -0.29 | **+0.05** | -0.09 | Judas has bearish CVD; acceptance is neutral |
| 5m FVGs (last 60m)        | 0.98  | **1.21** | 0.83 | More FVGs = more structural breaks = acceptance |
| Higher lows count         | 0.98  | **1.23** | 0.87 | More bullish structure in premarket → acceptance |
| 1m FVGs (last 60m)        | 6.40  | **6.91** | 5.43 | More micro-structure breaks for acceptance |

Features that are **NOT** differentiating:
- Total sweeps (~4.8 for all types — nearly everyone sweeps 5 levels)
- Clean breaks (~3.7 for all types)
- LRLR break rate (~10% for all types — too rare to discriminate)
- Gap at open (~0 pts for all types — NQ gaps are tiny)
- Chop score (direction changes) — ~0.50 for all types
- Open position in overnight range — ~55% for all types

## Acceptance Trade Outcomes by Premarket Condition

For the 71 actual acceptance trades from the backtest:

| Condition                 | Trades | WR    | Net P&L | PF   |
|:--------------------------|-------:|------:|--------:|-----:|
| **High chop score (>0.4)**    | **60** | **46.7%** | **$3,415** | **1.42** |
| Low chop score (≤0.4)    | 11     | 27.3% | -$242   | 0.87 |
| Strong PM momentum (>0.5)| 39     | 41.0% | $425    | 1.08 |
| **Weak PM momentum (≤0.3)**  | **13** | **46.2%** | **$795**  | **1.36** |
| 5m FVGs present           | 42     | 40.5% | $2,152  | 1.38 |
| No 5m FVGs               | 29     | 48.3% | $1,021  | 1.23 |
| LRLR break present       | 9      | 33.3% | $285    | 1.25 |
| No LRLR break            | 62     | 45.2% | $2,887  | 1.33 |
| CVD bullish              | 34     | 41.2% | $1,512  | 1.30 |
| CVD bearish              | 37     | 45.9% | $1,660  | 1.33 |

## Key Findings

### 1. Acceptance is the most common open type (37%), and 70% of the time it leads to continuation

This validates the concept: when NQ opens with acceptance past a key level, it tends to keep going.

### 2. COUNTER-INTUITIVE: High chop score is the BEST filter for acceptance trades

- High chop (>0.4): 60 trades, 46.7% WR, PF 1.42, +$3,415
- Low chop (≤0.4): 11 trades, 27.3% WR, PF 0.87, -$242

**Why?** A choppy premarket that resolves into acceptance at open is STRONGER than a directional premarket that continues. The chop → breakout pattern means the acceptance move is a genuine new impulse, not an exhausted continuation.

### 3. LRLR trendline breaks are too rare to be useful as a filter (10% of sessions)

Only 13/117 acceptance sessions had LRLR breaks, and those had a lower 30-min continuation rate (46% vs 73% without). The sample is very small (13) so this is not conclusive, but LRLR is not the primary driver.

### 4. Post-London directional strength is the best predictor of acceptance

Acceptance sessions have 0.53 directional ratio vs 0.39 for Judas. The period from 05:00-09:30 (after London) shows whether the overnight session established a clear direction.

### 5. Weak PM momentum paradoxically produces better acceptance trades

Weak momentum (≤0.3): 46.2% WR, PF 1.36 vs Strong momentum (>0.5): 41.0% WR, PF 1.08. This aligns with finding #2 — a quiet/choppy premarket that breaks into acceptance at RTH open is more reliable.

### 6. Gap at open is NOT a factor for NQ

All gap values are near zero (<1 pt average). NQ doesn't gap meaningfully at 9:30 because it trades nearly 24 hours.

### 7. CVD direction doesn't meaningfully separate acceptance from Judas trade quality

Both bullish and bearish CVD produce similar PFs (1.30 vs 1.33). The CVD-based entry confirmation already built into the strategy is sufficient.

## Implications for Strategy Improvement

### Filter to ADD: Eliminate Low Chop Score Sessions

A "chop_score ≤ 0.4" filter would eliminate the 11 losing trades (-$242, 27.3% WR) while keeping the 60 profitable ones ($3,415, 46.7% WR). This is the clearest actionable filter from this study.

**However**, the sample is small (11 trades) and this needs out-of-sample validation before implementing.

### Filter to NOT add: LRLR trendline break

Despite the user's hypothesis, LRLR breaks don't improve acceptance trade quality in the data. The 9 trades with LRLR had 33.3% WR vs 45.2% without. LRLR might be a visual pattern that confirms in hindsight but doesn't predict well.

### The 0-30 Min Trade Window

The continuation analysis shows 70% still going at 30 min (101 pts average). This supports the user's observation that acceptance is a "first 30 min trade." Current strategy uses IB window (60 bars) for acceptance detection, which is correct — but the TRADE itself peaks in the first 30 min.

## Next Steps

1. **Backtest chop_score filter**: add `pm_chop_score > 0.4` as a premarket filter and re-run OR Acceptance backtest
2. **Out-of-sample test**: split data into train/test to validate the chop filter isn't overfit
3. **Study the 22 BOTH sessions**: when both Judas AND acceptance fire, which wins?
4. **Post-London directional filter**: test `pm_post_london_directional > 0.45` as a complementary filter
5. **Early exit at 30 min**: test whether exiting acceptance trades at 30 min (instead of waiting for 2R target) improves results
