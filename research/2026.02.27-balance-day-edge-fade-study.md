## Executive Summary

This study tackles the missing piece of the strategy portfolio: **balance days** (B-day, P-day, Neutral, Wide IB). After the NT8 BalanceSignal failed (12.5% WR on B-days because it faded prior-day VA edges instead of IB edges), we went back to fundamentals.

| Finding | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Best balance day entry | **30min acceptance + IB mid target** |
| Win rate | **64% overall, 71% LONG-only** |
| Profit factor | **2.01** |
| Monthly P&L | **$3,394/mo (5 MNQ)** |
| Best direction | **LONG: 71% WR, $2,426/mo** |
| VWAP sweep-fail pattern | **Does NOT work** (45% WR, -$1,624/mo) |
| C-period rule | **Partially validated** (67% for IBH breaks, 57% for IBL) |
| Delta at rejection | **Not the primary filter here** (unlike bracket breakout) |

**The 30-min acceptance IB edge fade is the strongest strategy discovered, outperforming 80P on $/month ($3,394 vs $1,922).** The LONG side is dominant (71% WR) — consistent with NQ's structural long bias.

## Part 1: Day Type Foundation

### 1.1: Day Type Frequency (259 sessions)

| Day Type | Count | % | Per Month | Avg IB Range | Median IB Range |
|----------|-------|---|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **TREND** | **70** | **27%** | **5.9** | **171 pts** | **146 pts** |
| **P_DAY** | **79** | **31%** | **6.7** | **190 pts** | **180 pts** |
| **B_DAY** | **51** | **20%** | **4.3** | **206 pts** | **155 pts** |
| **NEUTRAL** | **59** | **23%** | **5.0** | **214 pts** | **198 pts** |

**Key findings:**
- **43% of sessions are balance days** (extension < 0.5x IB range) — our target universe
- **18% are wide balance** (IB > 200 pts + stays inside) — 4.0 per month
- P-day is the most common (31%), followed by Trend (27%), Neutral (23%), B-day (20%)
- Counterintuitively, **B-day and Neutral have the widest IB ranges** (206, 214 pts). These aren't "narrow" days — they're days where a wide range gets established early and holds.

### 1.2: IB Width vs Day Type

| IB Width | Count | % | Avg EOD Ext | % Balance |
|----------|-------|---|-------------|-----------|
| Narrow (<100) | 40 | 15% | **1.2x** | 25% |
| Normal (100-200) | 122 | 47% | 0.7x | 44% |
| Wide (200-300) | 66 | 25% | 0.7x | 44% |
| Very Wide (300-400) | 19 | 7% | 0.6x | 53% |
| Extreme (>400) | 12 | 5% | 0.6x | **67%** |

**Critical finding: Narrow IB = trend day (1.2x extension), Wide/Extreme IB = balance day (67% stay inside).** This confirms Dalton's framework — narrow IB predicts breakout, wide IB predicts rotation.

### 1.3: Early Identification — Can We Predict Day Type at 10:30?

| Predicted at IB | Actual TREND | Actual P_DAY | Actual B_DAY | Actual NEUTRAL | Accuracy |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| P_DAY | 36 | 50 | 27 | 41 | **32%** |
| B_DAY | 14 | 12 | 13 | 6 | **29%** |
| NEUTRAL | 20 | 17 | 11 | 12 | **20%** |

**Accuracy is terrible — 20-32%.** You cannot reliably predict EOD day type at IB close. The IB sets the range, but what happens after is unpredictable. This means **we should NOT filter by predicted day type. Instead, fade the IB edges on ANY day and let the acceptance model filter.**

### 1.4: C-Period Rule Validation

| C-Period Close | N | Continuation | Rate | Dalton Claim |
|----------------|---|-------------|------|-------------|
| Above IBH | 36 | 24 | **67%** | 70-75% |
| Below IBL | 44 | 25 | **57%** | 70-75% |
| Inside IB | 179 | 73 | **41%** | 70-75% reversal |

**Partially validated:**
- **Above IBH: 67%** — close to the 70-75% claim. When C-period breaks above IBH, there's a genuine continuation edge.
- **Below IBL: 57%** — weaker than claimed. NQ's long bias fights bear continuation.
- **Inside IB: 41%** — "reversal to opposite" claim NOT confirmed. Inside C-period is nearly random.

## Part 2: IB Edge Rejection Analysis

### 2.1: Touch Frequency

| Day Filter | IBH Touches | IBL Touches | Total | Sessions | Per Session |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------|----------|------------|
| All sessions | 1,226 | 932 | 2,158 | 242 | 8.9 |
| Balance days | 420 | 195 | 615 | 96 | **6.4** |
| Wide balance | 98 | 93 | 191 | 37 | 5.2 |

**On balance days: 6.4 touches per session.** There's no shortage of signals. The challenge is filtering quality.

**IBH touches outnumber IBL 2:1 on balance days** (420 vs 195). NQ's structural long bias means price pushes toward the high more often — more opportunities to SHORT at IBH, fewer at IBL.

### 2.2: Fade Success Rate (price returns to IB mid)

| Filter | N | Fade Success | Avg Max Adverse |
|--------|---|-------------|----------------|
| All touches | 2,158 | **12%** | 103 pts |
| Balance days | 615 | **17%** | 37 pts |
| **IBL LONG (balance)** | **195** | **27%** | **38 pts** |
| IBH SHORT (balance) | 420 | 12% | 37 pts |

**Raw fade success is low (12-17%).** Most touches extend rather than reverse. But:
- **IBL LONG on balance days = 27%** — more than double the overall rate
- IBH SHORT = only 12% — NQ long bias strikes again
- Acceptance models will dramatically filter these rates upward

### 2.3: First Touch vs Later Touches

| Touch # | N | Fade Success | Avg Adverse |
|---------|---|-------------|-------------|
| **Touch #1** | **111** | **33%** | **29 pts** |
| Touch #2 | 85 | 20% | 33 pts |
| Touch #3 | 70 | 13% | 38 pts |

**First touch is the strongest fade (33%).** Each subsequent touch is weaker. This confirms the trading axiom: "Fade the first test, respect the second."

### 2.4: Winner vs Loser Differentiation

| Factor | Winners | Losers | Edge |
|--------|---------|--------|------|
| Delta aligned | 35% | 38% | -3pp (no edge!) |
| Avg penetration | 12 pts | 18 pts | -6 pts |
| Avg vol spike | **1.4x** | 1.1x | **+0.3x** |
| Has BPR | 0% | 0% | 0pp |
| **2x5min accepted** | **100%** | **60%** | **+40pp** |

**Critical findings:**
- **Delta alignment is NOT the differentiator here** (-3pp) — unlike bracket breakout (where delta was the #1 filter at +55pp). IB edges are different from VA edges.
- **Acceptance is the #1 filter** (+40pp). All winners had 2x5min acceptance. This makes sense — the rejection needs TIME to confirm.
- **Volume spike matters** (+0.3x) — higher volume at the touch correlates with successful fades
- **BPR is useless** (0% for both) — BPR doesn't form at IB edges in practice
- **Deeper penetration = worse** (-6 pts) — small probes reverse, deep penetrations extend

---

## Part 3: Volume Profile Shape

### 3.1: IB POC Shape vs Day Type

| IB POC Shape | N | TREND | P_DAY | B_DAY | NEUTRAL | % Balance |
|-------------|---|-------|-------|-------|---------|-----------|
| P_SHAPE | 88 | 18% | **42%** | 19% | 20% | 48% |
| D_SHAPE | 119 | **36%** | 25% | 16% | 23% | 34% |
| B_SHAPE | 52 | 21% | 23% | **29%** | 27% | **54%** |

**IB POC shape has mild predictive value:**
- P-shape → 42% become P-day (expected, bullish skew = bullish continuation)
- D-shape → 36% become Trend (centered POC = directional breakout more likely)
- B-shape → 54% are balance days (highest balance rate)

### 3.2: POC Alignment with Fade Direction

| POC Alignment | N | Fade Success |
|--------------|---|-------------|
| Aligned | 465 | 15% |
| **Misaligned** | **150** | **23%** |

**Surprising: misaligned fades work BETTER.** Fading toward the POC (aligned) actually has lower success (15%) than fading away from it (23%). This suggests that **when POC is at the opposite end, the fade has more room to run** — there's a bigger mean-reversion gap.

### 3.3: VWAP as Demarcation — THE KEY FINDING

| VWAP vs IB Mid | Fade Dir | N | Fade Success | Hypothesis |
|---------------|---------|---|-------------|-----------|
| **VWAP above mid** | **LONG (IBL fade)** | **63** | **46%** | **ALIGNED** |
| VWAP above mid | SHORT (IBH fade) | 248 | 15% | MISALIGNED |
| VWAP below mid | LONG (IBL fade) | 132 | 18% | MISALIGNED |
| VWAP below mid | SHORT (IBH fade) | 172 | 9% | ALIGNED |

**VWAP above IB midpoint + IBL LONG = 46% raw fade success.** This is the strongest raw filter found — nearly triple the baseline (17%). When VWAP sits above the IB midpoint, it acts as a magnet pulling price back up from IBL touches.

The "aligned SHORT" (VWAP below mid + IBH short) only shows 9% — further confirming NQ's structural long bias kills shorts even with VWAP alignment.

---

## Part 4: Acceptance Model Comparison

### 4.1: Which Acceptance Model Works Best?

| Model | N (accepted) | Fade Success | Not Accepted | Filter Value |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 2x1min consecutive | 473 | 22% | 0% | +22pp |
| **2x5min consecutive** | **410** | **26%** | **0%** | **+26pp** |
| **1x30min close** | **285** | **32%** | **4%** | **+28pp** |
| Delta aligned only | 233 | 16% | 18% | -2pp |

**30-min acceptance is the strongest filter (+28pp)**, followed by 2x5min (+26pp). Delta alone provides no value as a filter for IB edges (-2pp). This is fundamentally different from bracket breakout where delta was king.

**Why delta doesn't work for IB fades:** At composite VA edges, delta measures institutional defense of a structural level. At IB edges, the level was established just hours ago — it doesn't have the same structural significance. The market needs TIME (30 min acceptance) to prove the rejection, not just order flow.

### 4.2: Acceptance + Delta Combined

| Combo | N | Fade Success | Avg Adverse |
|-------|---|-------------|-------------|
| 2x5min + delta | 135 | 27% | 29 pts |
| **30min + delta** | **90** | **33%** | **22 pts** |
| 2x1min + delta | 161 | 23% | 32 pts |

Adding delta to 30min barely changes the success rate (33% vs 32%) but reduces adverse excursion (22 vs 28 pts). The delta helps with risk management, not win rate.

## Part 5: Entry Model Backtests

### 5.1: The Money Table

| Config | N | T/Mo | WR | PF | $/Mo |
|--------|---|------|-----|-----|------|
| A: 2x5min → IB mid | 410 | 34.8 | 51% | 1.30 | $1,822 |
| B: 2x5min + delta → IB mid | 135 | 11.5 | 53% | 1.46 | $957 |
| C: 2x5min + delta + BPR/FVG | 24 | 2.0 | 58% | 1.48 | $208 |
| E: 2x5min → VWAP | 410 | 34.8 | 50% | 1.27 | $1,660 |
| **F: 2x5min + delta → dynamic** | **135** | **11.5** | **54%** | **1.61** | **$1,269** |
| G: Delta-only (no accept) | 233 | 19.8 | 56% | 1.56 | $1,481 |
| **H: 30min accept → IB mid** | **285** | **24.2** | **64%** | **2.01** | **$3,394** |
| I: 2x1min → IB mid | 473 | 40.2 | 48% | 1.20 | $1,390 |
| J: 2x5min + delta → 2R | 135 | 11.5 | 47% | 1.01 | $23 |

**Clear winner: 30-min acceptance + IB midpoint target (Config H)**
- **64% WR, PF 2.01, $3,394/mo** — outperforms every strategy in the system
- 24.2 trades/month = very active
- The 30-min confirmation filters out false touches and noise

**Why 2R target fails (Config J, $23/mo):** IB edge fades are mean-reversion trades. 2R requires the move to be 3x the risk, but on balance days the range is defined — price oscillates within the IB. 2R overshoots the natural target.

### 5.2: LONG vs SHORT (The Critical Split)

**Best config (30min accept → IB mid):**

| Direction | N | WR | $/Mo |
|-----------|---|------|------|
| **LONG** | **126** | **71%** | **$2,426** |
| SHORT | 159 | 57% | $968 |

**LONG is dramatically better: 71% WR vs 57% SHORT.** NQ's structural long bias means IBL fades (LONG) work consistently, while IBH fades (SHORT) are coin-flip territory.

Even the SHORT side is positive ($968/mo) — unlike trend day shorts which are catastrophically negative. Balance day IBH shorts work because they're mean-reversion (targeting IB mid, not a trend continuation).

### 5.3: Filter Stacking

| Filter Stack | N | WR | PF | $/Mo | T/Mo |
|-------------|---|------|-----|------|------|
| Baseline: all balance touches | 615 | 53% | 1.37 | $2,773 | 52.2 |
| + 2x5min accepted | 410 | 51% | 1.30 | $1,822 | 34.8 |
| + delta aligned | 135 | 53% | 1.46 | $957 | 11.5 |
| + POC shape aligned | 93 | 52% | 1.51 | $629 | 7.9 |
| **LONG only (2x5min + delta)** | **54** | **67%** | **2.51** | **$932** | **4.6** |

**LONG-only with 2x5min + delta = 67% WR, PF 2.51** — excellent quality but lower frequency (4.6/mo).

## Part 5B: VWAP Sweep-Fail Pattern

The user's concept: price sweeps above/below VWAP and fails → trade back to opposite edge.

| Direction | N | WR | Avg P&L | $/Mo |
|-----------|---|------|---------|------|
| LONG | 182 | 46% | -2.8 pts | -$785 |
| SHORT | 153 | 44% | -4.2 pts | -$838 |
| **TOTAL** | **335** | **45%** | **-3.5 pts** | **-$1,624** |

**The VWAP sweep-fail pattern does NOT work mechanically.** 45% WR with negative P&L on both sides. The problem: VWAP sweeps on balance days are often just noise — price oscillates around VWAP naturally. The "sweep and fail" doesn't have the structural significance of an IB edge rejection.

**This doesn't mean VWAP is useless** — VWAP position relative to IB mid IS a powerful filter (46% fade success when VWAP above mid + IBL long). But the sweep-fail as a standalone entry doesn't have edge.

---

## Part 6: Wide IB Balance Days

**Wide IB balance days (IB > 200 pts, stays inside):** 47 sessions (18%), 4.0/month

| Metric | Wide IB Balance | All Balance | Difference |
|--------|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| IB Range | 323 pts (mean) | 198 pts | +125 pts |
| Fade success (raw) | 11% | 17% | -6pp |
| Avg max adverse | 58 pts | 37 pts | +21 pts |

**Raw fade success is worse on wide IB (11% vs 17%)** — but with proper filtering:

**Wide IB + 2x5min + delta = 65% WR, PF 2.96, $1,237/mo**

The wider range means bigger stops but also bigger targets. The PF (2.96) is higher than the overall best (2.01), suggesting wide IB balance days produce higher-quality fades when filtered.

---

## Conclusions

### What We Proved

1. **30-min acceptance is the #1 filter for IB edge fades.** 64% WR, PF 2.01, $3,394/mo. The rejection needs TIME to confirm, not just delta. This is fundamentally different from bracket breakout (where delta was king).

2. **LONG fades at IBL are dramatically better than SHORT fades at IBH.** 71% WR LONG vs 57% SHORT. NQ's structural long bias means IBL is natural support.

3. **Day type prediction at IB close is useless** (20-32% accuracy). Don't try to predict the day type — instead, fade every IB edge on every day and let acceptance filter the noise.

4. **First touch is the strongest fade** (33% raw success vs 20% for second touch). "Fade the first test, respect the second."

5. **VWAP above IB mid = bullish demarcation** (46% raw IBL fade success vs 18% when VWAP below). VWAP position is the best structural filter, not delta or POC shape.

6. **VWAP sweep-fail as standalone entry does NOT work** (45% WR, -$1,624/mo). The oscillation around VWAP on balance days is noise, not signal.

7. **C-period rule is partially valid.** 67% continuation when C breaks above IBH (close to 70-75% claim), 57% for bears (weaker), inside IB = random (41%).

8. **Delta at IB edges is NOT the primary filter** (unlike bracket breakout). Delta worked at +55pp for composite VA edges (institutional levels with days of history) but only -2pp for IB edges (established hours ago). Acceptance time is what matters.

9. **Wide IB balance days work with higher PF (2.96)** when filtered, producing $1,237/mo from 40 trades.

10. **Balance day edge fading is NOT a duplicate of 80P.** 80P requires opening outside prior VA. Balance day fading uses the CURRENT session's IB as the range. Different setup, different levels, different trades.

### Strategy Portfolio Updated

| Strategy | WR | PF | $/Mo | Risk | Frequency | Day Types |
|----------|-----|-----|------|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Balance IB Fade (30min)** | **64%** | **2.01** | **$3,394** | **44p** | **24.2/mo** | **B/P/N** |
| 80P (Limit 50% VA + 4R) | 44.7% | 2.57 | $1,922 | 60p | 4.0/mo | All (open outside VA) |
| Delta-only IB fade | 56% | 1.56 | $1,481 | 33p | 19.8/mo | B/P/N |
| 2x5min + delta dynamic | 54% | 1.61 | $1,269 | 43p | 11.5/mo | B/P/N |
| LONG-only 2x5min + delta | 67% | 2.51 | $932 | 43p | 4.6/mo | B/P/N |
| 20P (3x5min + 2xATR + 2R) | 45.5% | 1.78 | $496 | 32p | 3.7/mo | Trend |
| Bracket Retrace + Delta | 83% | ~5.0 | $360 | 15p | 2.0/mo | Breakout |

### Follow-Up Research

1. **Overlap analysis with 80P** — On days where both 80P and balance day fade fire, are they the same trade at different levels?
2. **30-min acceptance optimization** — Is 25 or 35 bars better than 30? Test nearby values.
3. **IB width segmentation** — Different stop/target sizing for narrow (100-200) vs wide (200-400) IB?
4. **Monthly consistency** — Is the $3,394/mo stable or driven by a few outlier months?
5. **Live execution feasibility** — 24 trades/month = ~1/day. Is there a concentration in specific sessions?
6. **Combine first-touch-only filter** — First touch at 33% base rate with 30min acceptance could be extremely high quality
