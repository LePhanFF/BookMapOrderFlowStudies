- 5 accounts copy-trade the same signals = 5x the payouts
- Expected payback: ~1 month

---

## Strategy Portfolio

All strategies use **5 MNQ contracts** maximum. The regime filter blocks all short signals except Strategy 5 (selective IBH sweep short).

### Strategy 1: Trend Day Bull (Dalton Playbook)

**Backtest:** 8 trades | 75.0% WR | $1,074 net | $134/trade

**What it trades:** Strong trending days where price accepts above the Initial Balance High and pulls back to VWAP.

**Day types:** trend_up, super_trend_up, p_day

**Entry rules:**
1. Wait for Initial Balance to form (9:30–10:30 AM ET)
2. Price must **accept above IBH**: 2+ consecutive 5-min closes above IBH
3. Wait for **pullback to VWAP** (price within 0.4x IB range of VWAP)
4. Entry bar must close above VWAP
5. Delta > 0 on entry bar (buyers present)
6. Pre-entry momentum: sum of last 10 bars' delta > -500
7. Order flow quality gate — 2 of 3 must be true:
   - delta_percentile >= 60th
   - imbalance_ratio > 1.0
   - volume_spike >= 1.0
8. Trend bull confidence >= 0.375
9. Entry window: **10:30 AM – 1:00 PM ET**

**Stop:** VWAP - (0.4 x IB range), minimum 15 pts

**Target:** Entry + (2.0 x IB range) for trend days, 1.5x for p_day

**Trail:** After 1:00 PM, trail stop to breakeven if profit > 0.3x IB range

---

### Strategy 2: P-Day VWAP Long (Skewed Balance)

**Backtest:** 8 trades | 75.0% WR | $992 net | $124/trade

**What it trades:** P-shaped balance days with bullish skew — short covering pushes price above IBH, then holds.

**Day types:** p_day

**Entry rules:**
1. Wait for **directional acceptance**: 2+ consecutive closes above IBH
2. This confirms P-shape (bullish skew)
3. Wait for **pullback to VWAP** (within 0.4x IB range)
4. Entry bar must close above VWAP with delta > 0
5. Pre-entry momentum: sum of last 10 bars' delta > -500
6. Order flow quality: 2 of 3 (delta_pctl >= 60, imbalance > 1.0, vol_spike >= 1.0)
7. Entry window: **10:30 AM – 1:00 PM ET**
8. One entry per session maximum

**Stop:** VWAP - (0.4 x IB range), minimum 15 pts

**Target:** Entry + (1.5 x IB range)

**Trail:** Breakeven after 1:00 PM if profit > 0.3x IB range

> **SHORTS DISABLED.** P-day short signals showed 0–22% WR on NQ.

---

### Strategy 3: B-Day IBL Fade (Balance Day Long)

**Backtest:** 4 trades | 100% WR | $1,486 net | $372/trade

**What it trades:** True balance days where price is trapped inside the IB range. Fades rejection at the IB Low for a mean reversion to IB mid.

**Day types:** b_day

**Entry rules:**
1. Day classified as b_day with confidence >= 0.5
2. Trend strength must be "weak" (no IB extension)
3. IB range < 400 pts
4. Price **touches or wicks below IBL**
5. Entry bar must **close back above IBL** (rejection confirmed)
6. Delta > 0 (buyers stepping in at low)
7. Quality score >= 2 from:
   - FVG/IFVG bull zone present
   - Delta rejection (delta > 0)
   - Multi-touch (2+ tests of IBL)
   - Volume spike > 1.3x
8. Risk:Reward check: risk/reward must be < 2.5
9. Entry window: **before 2:00 PM ET**
10. One entry per session maximum

**Stop:** IBL - (0.10 x IB range)

**Target:** IB midpoint (VWAP/POC mean reversion)

**Trail:** Breakeven after 1:00 PM if profit > 0.3x IB range

> **This strategy trades on different days than Strategy 5 (zero date overlap).** On b_days, you may get both an IBL fade LONG and an IBH sweep SHORT — these are complementary, not conflicting.

---

### Strategy 4: Mean Reversion VWAP (Long Only)

**Backtest:** 9 trades | 66.7% WR | $309 net | $34/trade

**What it trades:** Oversold conditions on balance/range days where price deviates significantly below VWAP, then reverts.

**Day types:** b_day, neutral, p_day

**Entry rules:**
1. Day type must be b_day, neutral, or p_day
2. IB range >= 15 pts
3. **Price deviation from VWAP >= 0.6x IB range**
4. Price is BELOW VWAP (for long entry)
5. RSI14 < 35 (oversold)
6. Volume spike < 1.2 (exhaustion, not continuation selling)
7. Delta > 0 (buyers stepping in)
8. Candle reversal: close > open (bullish bar)
9. Risk:Reward check: reward >= 0.8x risk
10. Entry window: **11:00 AM – 2:30 PM ET**
11. Max 2 entries per session, 15-bar cooldown between entries

**Stop:** Below session low or bar low - (0.25 x IB range), minimum 12 pts

**Target:** VWAP (full mean reversion)

**Trail:** Breakeven at 50% distance to VWAP

> **SHORTS DISABLED.** Short mean reversion showed 37.5% WR on NQ.

---

### Strategy 5: B-Day IBH Sweep Short (Selective)

**Backtest:** 5 trades | 80.0% WR | $2,889 net | $578/trade

**What it trades:** Liquidity sweep above IBH on balance days — price pokes 15+ pts above IBH to grab stops, then closes back below IBH. This is a "poke and fake" setup.

**Day types:** b_day only

**Entry qualification (ALL must be true):**
1. Day is currently classified as **b_day** (price inside IB, no extension)
2. A bar's high goes **15+ pts above IBH** (deep liquidity grab)
3. That same bar **closes below IBH** (failure to hold = trapped longs)
4. **Delta < 0** on the sweep bar (selling pressure confirms rejection)
5. Bar opened above IBH (the probe came FROM above, not a push-through)
6. Entry window: **10:30 AM – 2:00 PM ET**
7. First sweep only (max 1 trade per session)

**Entry:** SHORT at the close of the failure candle

**Stop:** Sweep bar high + (0.15 x IB range), minimum 15 pts above entry

**Target:** IB midpoint

**Trail:** None — let it run to target or stop

**Why this works:**
- On b_day, there is NO structural reason for price to hold above IBH
- The 15+ pt sweep exhausts buyers (they chased the breakout and got trapped)
- Negative delta confirms real selling, not just a wick
- 94% of IBH breaks fail — but only the BIG sweeps (15+ pts) revert reliably

**What NOT to short:**
- Sweeps < 15 pts (42.9% WR, breakeven) — too shallow to confirm exhaustion
- P_day sweeps (23% WR) — momentum is trying to accept above IBH
- Sweeps with positive delta (0% WR) — buying into the sweep = continuation, not failure
- Sweeps near HTF resistance (PDH, prior 3-day high) — counterintuitively, more confluence = less reversion

## Position Sizing & Risk Management

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Max contracts per trade | 5 MNQ |
| Risk per trade | $400 max |
| Contract sizing formula | $400 / (stop_distance_pts x $2/pt) |
| Self-imposed daily loss limit | -$750 |
| Max trades per day | 2 |
| Account drawdown limit (Lightning) | $4,500 EOD trailing |

**Example sizing:**
- Stop distance = 30 pts
- Contracts = $400 / (30 x $2) = 6.67 → capped at 5 MNQ
- Actual risk = 5 x 30 x $2 = $300

---

## Daily Execution Routine

### Pre-Market (8:30–9:30 AM ET)
1. Check prior session: was it bullish or bearish?
2. Note prior day high (PDH), prior day low (PDL), overnight high
3. Check if today gapped up or down from prior close
4. Decision: trade or sit based on confidence level

### Initial Balance Formation (9:30–10:30 AM ET)
1. **DO NOT TRADE** during this window
2. Record IB High and IB Low at 10:30 AM
3. Calculate IB range (IBH - IBL)
4. Begin classifying day type from extension behavior

### Post-IB Trading (10:30 AM – 2:30 PM ET)

**If price accepts above IBH** (2+ closes above):
- Watch for VWAP pullback → **Strategy 1 (Trend Bull)** or **Strategy 2 (P-Day)**

**If price stays inside IB** (b_day forming):
- Watch for IBL rejection → **Strategy 3 (B-Day IBL Fade Long)**
- Watch for IBH sweep + failure (15+ pts, close below) → **Strategy 5 (IBH Sweep Short)**

**If price deviates below VWAP** (0.6x+ IB range):
- Watch for RSI < 35 + delta reversal → **Strategy 4 (Mean Reversion VWAP)**

### PM Session (1:00–3:00 PM ET)
1. Trail winning positions to breakeven (if profit > 0.3x IB range)
2. No new entries after 2:30 PM
3. Watch for VWAP breach exit on non-trend positions

### Close (3:00–4:00 PM ET)
1. Close all positions by end of day
2. EOD exits historically have 100% WR — winners drift in your favor all session

## How to Pass the Evaluation

### The Math

- You need to accumulate profit without hitting the $4,500 trailing drawdown
- At 5 MNQ with this playbook, your max observed daily loss is -$327
- Your average win is ~$176, average loss is ~$70
- You generate roughly 1.5 trades per active day, with 30% of sessions being active
- **Expected time to first payout: ~30 trading days (~6 weeks)**

### Rules to Follow

1. **Never exceed 5 MNQ** — the edge exists at this size. Increasing size increases risk without proportional reward
2. **Stick to LONG only** (except the selective Strategy 5 short) — every short strategy tested showed 0–42% WR on NQ
3. **Do not trade during IB** (9:30–10:30) — you need the IB levels to classify the day
4. **Do not take profit early** — EOD exits have 100% WR. Winners drift all day. Let them run
5. **Max 2 trades per day** — from backtest, average was 1.5 per active day
6. **Self-impose -$750 daily stop** — this is well under Lightning's $3,750 DLL and protects the account
7. **Do not force trades** — 70% of sessions produce no signals. That's by design

### Consistency Rule Strategy

The Lightning consistency rule (no single day > 20% of total profit for 1st payout) passes naturally with this playbook:

- Backtest best single day: $633 (14.5% of $4,352 total — under 20%)
- At 5 MNQ, max possible daily profit is ~$600–800
- You need 5+ winning days to spread profit — backtest had 14 winning days in 62 sessions
- Win day rate: 73.7%
- If you're approaching the threshold, **skip remaining trades for the day**

### What Can Go Wrong

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Losing streak | At 75.9% WR, probability of 5 consecutive losses is 0.08%. Even 3 in a row is only 1.4% |
| Max drawdown hit | Max observed daily loss -$327. Need 13+ worst days in a row to hit $4,500 DD |
| Regime change | System remains profitable down to ~55% WR. Even at 60% WR stress test: 99.9% survival |
| Overtrading | Hard cap at 2 trades/day. No entries after 2:30 PM. No trades during IB |
| Emotional deviation | Copy-trade eliminates discretion. Same signal → same execution on all 5 accounts |

---

## How to Trade Funded Accounts

### Copy Trading Setup (5 Accounts)

All 5 Lightning accounts trade identical signals simultaneously:

1. Use your charting platform (NinjaTrader, TradingView, or BookMap) for signal generation on the primary account
2. When a signal triggers, place the same order on all 5 accounts
3. All accounts use 5 MNQ per trade
4. Total exposure: 25 MNQ across 5 accounts (5 each)
5. Stagger payouts across accounts (7-day minimum between payouts per account)
6. If one account approaches drawdown limit, reduce to 3 MNQ on that account only

### Payout Strategy

- **Target per account:** ~$760/month ($9,122/year) at realistic 70% WR
- **Target total (5 accounts):** ~$3,497/month ($41,965/year)
- Request payouts every 7–10 trading days when balance exceeds $1,000
- Keep $500 buffer in each account above the drawdown watermark
- Max withdrawal per payout: ~$5,000 (90% to you = $4,500)

### Monthly Income Projections (Monte Carlo, 10,000 simulations)

| Scenario | Win Rate | Monthly (5 accts) | Survival | Profitable |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Backtest exact | 75.9% | $5,373 | 99.7% | 100% |
| **Realistic live** | **70.0%** | **$3,497** | **100%** | **100%** |
| Conservative | 65.0% | $2,503 | 100% | 100% |
| Stress test | 60.0% | $1,386 | 99.9% | 100% |

Even under the worst-case stress test (60% WR with 1.5x worse losses), the system remains profitable with 99.9% survival.

## Why LONG Only on NQ

This was the single most important finding across all research. Every short strategy was exhaustively tested:

| Short Study | Result |
|---|---|
| Fade AT IBH (12 configs) | ALL negative. Best: 67.3% WR, -$2,282 |
| Failed breakout short (14 configs) | Best: 50% WR, +$962 (marginal) |
| HTF confluence short | More confluence = LESS reversion (counterintuitive) |
| Regime-filtered shorts (bear only) | 20% WR, -$2,154 |
| Unfiltered IBH sweep short | 42.9% WR, -$41 (breakeven) |

**The core problem:** NQ has structural long bias. When short targets hit, average win is $100–700. When short stops hit, average loss is $400–650 (3–4x bigger). This asymmetry destroys profitability even at 60–70% WR.

**The one exception:** Strategy 5 (IBH Sweep Short) works ONLY because:
- The 15+ pt sweep filter is highly selective (5 trades in 62 sessions)
- Big sweeps genuinely exhaust buyers (liquidity is fully grabbed)
- B-day structure means no reason for price to hold above IBH
- Negative delta confirms real institutional selling, not just noise

## Strategy Performance Summary

| # | Strategy | Trades | Win Rate | Net P&L | Avg/Trade | Direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Trend Day Bull | 8 | 75.0% | $1,074 | $134 | LONG |
| 2 | P-Day VWAP Long | 8 | 75.0% | $992 | $124 | LONG |

| | **COMBINED** | **34** | **76.5%** | **$6,750** | **$199** | |

---

## What NOT to Do

- **DO NOT short NQ** outside of Strategy 5's strict criteria
- **DO NOT increase beyond 5 MNQ** per trade
- **DO NOT trade during IB formation** (9:30–10:30 AM)
- **DO NOT take profit early** — let positions run to target or EOD
- **DO NOT add EMA Trend Follow or ORB strategies** — they drop WR below 70%
- **DO NOT chase entries** without order flow confirmation (delta > 0, quality gate)
- **DO NOT force trades** on days without clear signals — 70% of sessions are no-trade days
- **DO NOT skip the pre-entry momentum check** (10-bar delta sum > -500)
- **DO NOT short p_day sweeps** — 23% WR death zone
- **DO NOT short small sweeps** (< 15 pts) — 42.9% WR, breakeven at best

## Key Research Findings

### What Makes Winners Win (from deep filter analysis)

The strongest statistical discriminators between winning and losing trades (Cohen's d > 0.5):

| Feature | Winners | Losers | Effect Size | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sweep size | 14.3 pts | 8.5 pts | d=0.71 | Bigger sweeps exhaust buyers more |
| Sweep/IB ratio | 0.08x | 0.05x | d=0.88 | Relative size matters |
| Bar delta | -271 | -76 | d=0.62 | Strong selling = confirmation |
| Delta z-score | -1.71 | -0.68 | d=0.78 | Extreme selling = high conviction |
| Wick ratio | 0.09 | 0.22 | d=0.68 | Low wick = decisive failure close |
| Max favorable | 76 pts | 21 pts | d=2.12 | Winners move hard in your favor |
| Max adverse | 13 pts | 51 pts | d=2.99 | Losers immediately go against you |

### Counterintuitive Finding: HTF Confluence Hurts Shorts

More higher-timeframe confluence (PDH, overnight high, prior 3-day high, bearish FVGs) actually produced **less** reversion after failed breakouts:

| Confluences | VWAP Hit Rate | Avg Drop |
|---|---|---|
| 0 (clean) | 75% | 206 pts |
| 1 | 47% | 83 pts |
| 2+ | 29% | 52 pts |

The best short setups are clean failures with no nearby HTF levels.

### 94% of IBH Breaks Fail

Out of 32 sessions with IBH breaks, 30 (94%) failed to sustain above IBH. Most were "quick fakes" — barely 0.15x IB extension above before reversing. 83% had positive delta on the breakout bar (exhaustion buying, not institutional accumulation).
